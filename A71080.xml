            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,368 texts created during Phase 1 of the project (2000-2009), initially available only to institutions that contributed to their creation, were released into the public domain on 1 January 2015. The approximately 40,000 texts produced during Phase 2 (2009- ), of which 34,963 had been released as of 2020, originally similarly restricted, were similarly freed from all restrictions on 1 August 2020. As of that date anyone is free to take and use these texts for any purpose (modify them, annotate them, distribute them, etc.). But we do respectfully request that due credit and attribution be given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

            <head>THE PREFACE.</head>
            <p>THeſe Papers were not deſigned to be publiſhed, till after the ſurren<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der of the City of <hi>Mons</hi> to the <hi>French;</hi> for ſince there are ſome, and thoſe too calling themſelves <hi>Proteſtants,</hi> who upon all oc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>caſions make it their buſineſs to advance the Conqueſts of that King, and at the ſame time to leſſen the Conduct and Succeſs of His Preſent Majeſty; re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſenting his Affairs to be in ſuch a Condition at Home, and his Army ſo in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>conſiderable in <hi>Ireland,</hi> that they preſently from thence expect ſuch a Turn of State, as, if it ſhould happen, would certainly prove unfortunate and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtructive to themſelves, as well as other people; tho they have no mind, or at leaſt do not ſeem to ſee it. I do not pretend (nor do I think it poſſible) to make ſuch men ſenſible of the folly of their unaccountable Behaviour at this Juncture; only I think it a good Opportunity, to let Them and the World know the impartial Truth of the moſt material Paſſages of the Two laſt Cam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>paigns in <hi>Ireland,</hi> with the true State of both Armies, as it ſtood in <hi>Janu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ary</hi> laſt; which poſſibly, may ſerve to mortifie all their Expectations from their Friends in that Kingdom. And as to the Matters of Fact, I defie all the Enemies of our Government and Religion to contradict me; tho at the ſame time, I aſſure them, That I have done their Side all the Right that the thing it ſelf will bear, and have concealed nothing that I think could make any way for their Advantage.</p>
            <p>But before I come to this, I will take the liberty to ſpeak out, ſince I am to treat of an Affair that concerns all that value either the publick Safety, Honour or Peace of their Native Countrey; it being every day more apparent than other, that we are deſigned as a Prey to that Nation, to whom we nor our Fathers were never yet in Bondage. This is no vain and groundleſs Fear or Pretention, but the Reaſons for it are many: Amongſt the reſt, take only theſe few.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Firſt,</hi> The Late King, by his unhappy Management, has given up the Cudgels to the <hi>French</hi> (whom it's not to be doubted, he had rather ſhould govern the Nation, than thoſe who at preſent do) by this means placing his
<pb facs="tcp:98441:5"/> own Intereſt, and that of all <hi>Engliſh Proteſtants,</hi> in a diametrical oppoſiti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on to one another; ſince it's plain, that unfortunate Prince has been made in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtrumental (and is ſo ſtill) by the Zealots of the Church of <hi>Rome,</hi> to advance their Religion, on the one hand; and by his moſt Chriſtian Majeſty on the other, to promote his Glory. All the Care and Pains that has been taken of late by the Prieſts, in a Buſineſs of the greateſt moment, was, not to propagate King <hi>James</hi>'s Family, but his and their own Religion; for they value not tho He and His Name periſh, if their Work go but on: And (ſuppoſe the P. of <hi>W.</hi> really what our Adverſaries would have him.) who can ever imagine that a Succeſſor, that there was ſo much pains taken about, will either be bred a Proteſtant, or made ſerviceable to that Inte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reſt; eſpecially, ſince he is taken out of the Kingdom, and put into the hands of the greateſt Enemy to our Nation? And as to the <hi>French</hi> King's part, can any one think, that he does all this out of a Principle of Honour and Love, for the re-eſtabliſhing of King <hi>James?</hi> All people know, that his Generoſity extends no further than his Intereſt: Thoſe that will not believe this, let them only look back upon his treatment of the ſame individual Prince ſome years ago; for it's plain, that he has no other Proſpect nor regard to Men and Things, but his own Greatneſs and Ambition; not ſpearing even thoſe of his own Perſwaſion, when they ſtand in his way: Every one ſees, that hsi Brother of <hi>Conſtantinople</hi> and he, agree much bet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter than his Holy Father at <hi>Rome</hi> and he ever did, or are like to do; be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe the former is more favourable to his Deſigns than the other. If then he falls out with him, whom his own Religion obliges to pay all Defer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rence and Reſpect to, and honour as a Father; what can <hi>Proteſtants,</hi> nay even <hi>Engliſh Papiſts</hi> themſelves expect, but to ſubmit to his Yoke, if they once give way for his Admiſſion? When the Late King appear'd all on a ſudden laſt Summer in <hi>France,</hi> after the Defeat at the <hi>Boyn,</hi> it was obſervable, that tho the <hi>French</hi> King was ſurprized at his Preſence, yet he received him with all the ſeeming joy in the World; thinking it not fit to diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>courage a Prince, whom he had ſtill further occaſion for. This has already been ſeen into by ſome great Officers, even in the <hi>Iriſh</hi> Army; who begin to be at a ſtand how to manage, ſince they can have no other Proſpect from the ſucceſs of their own preſent Affairs, but future Ruin to their Countrey.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Secondly,</hi> Suppoſe the War already ended, and the Late King ſent in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to <hi>England,</hi> with all the Grandeur that <hi>France</hi> could afford him, and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived here by the conſent of every Body: Yet the <hi>French</hi> King has a very large Bill to bring in, which he'll certainly pretend cannot be diſcharged with the Poſſ<gap reason="illegible" resp="#OXF" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>ſſion of <hi>Ireland;</hi> what then can be more rationally intended, than that one day or other, <hi>England</hi> may be brought to a ſevere account for thoſe
<pb facs="tcp:98441:5"/> vaſt Expences, and the non-repayment of them ſhall be a ſufficient Pretence for a War, when he finds an Opportunity, tho King <hi>James</hi> himſelf ſate at the Helm? For how eaſy a thing it is to break all Rules whatever, when a man has the Power in his own hand, is known to moſt men. Thoſe then who favour him moſt, will only have the honour to be laſt devoured; and e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven thoſe of his own Perſuaſion, will have cauſe to wiſh themſelves, rather under a <hi>Proteſtant</hi> Prince, than a <hi>Popiſh</hi> Tyrant: We ſee further, that His Preſent Majeſty has not declared it a War of Religion, but is link<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed in a Confederacy with a great many Princes of the <hi>Romiſh</hi> Church, that have all the ſame reaſon to dread the growing-Power of <hi>France,</hi> who neither ſpares Proteſtant when he has an opportunity, nor a Papiſt when he can gain by it. And yet if we look narrowly into the thing, the preſent War of <hi>Ireland</hi> is both more difficult and expenſive for him to ſupport, than it is for <hi>England,</hi> both as to the diſtance of place, and multiplicity of other Diverſions; for tho he's a great Prince, yet his Power is not without limits.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Thirdly,</hi> It neither was, nor is the Intereſt of Their preſent Majeſties only that we are ſtruggling for, but under them for the Liberties of <hi>England,</hi> and that againſt the moſt dangerous Enemy that our Nation ever had: this moſt men think themſelves obliged to do, tho the King's natural Life ſhould end to morrow (which God forbid, ſince for his own ſake all that have had the honour to be Eye-witneſſes of thoſe Noble and Heroick Perſonal Actions of His Majeſty, in purſuance of what he ſo generouſly undertook at firſt, dare, and will ſerve him even to death it ſelf, what he pleaſes to command them) for the Quarrel is not, Whether the Late King, or the Preſent, ſhall Rule in <hi>England?</hi> but whether the <hi>French</hi> King ſhall have our Countrey, or we keep it to our ſelves? Neither is it only the King and Queen's Quarrel that we ſpend ſo much Treaſure in, and loſe thoſe Men (as is frequently objected) but it's the King that makes himſelf a Drudge for ours (if I may ſo expreſs it) running all Hazards, and ſuffering all Hardſhips poſſible up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on that Account. He was a Rich and Great Prince before, and wanted nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther Glory nor Power to have lived happy and magnificent; nor is it likely he had any Deſign to provide for his Poſterity in what he did, ſince we are as yet deprived of ſo great a Bleſſing. And whatever may be called unnatural in this War, is for the Father of his Country to endeavour the depriving both his Natural and Legal Children of what God and Nature have made them Heirs to.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Fourthly,</hi> King <hi>James</hi> might have been one of the greateſt and happieſt Princes in <hi>Europe,</hi> notwithſtanding his Religion; and the <hi>Roman-Catho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>licks</hi> enjoyed the ſame Privilege as to the exerciſe of theirs, that other Diſſen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters do at this day, if that would but have pleaſed them; but it was an odd
<pb facs="tcp:98441:6"/> thing to all men of thought, that the hundredth part of a Nation, (as the Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>piſts are no more at beſt) ſhould think to bring all the reſt over to their Side, and that againſt both their Humours and Intereſts; but it's now plain, that the Affairs of <hi>England</hi> and <hi>Rome</hi> cannot be reconciled. And I would fain ask any Proteſtant, Whether in King <hi>James</hi>'s time he would not have been wil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling with all his heart to have been ſecured from the approaching Danger? Or whether he thinks it p<gap reason="illegible" resp="#OXF" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>ſſible this could have been done more eaſily, or more to the ſatisfaction of the Nation in general, than it was? But this is the miſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chief of it, we all would be out of harms way, but then every man muſt do it as he himſelf thinks fit, or elſe it all ſtands for nothing. If King <hi>Wil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liam</hi> had made his entry through a Sea of Blood, this had pleaſed ſome Peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple better, and made others more afraid; the Eaſineſs of the thing was the greateſt Providence in it; and yet by our fickle Factious Humours we begin to make it both more expenſive and hazardous; but let us take heed, leſt if we tread in the Steps of our Forefathers in Diviſions and homebred Jarrings, we alſo run the ſame fate in being ſubject to a Nation of Foreigners; and yet it's to be feared, that the real ground of ſome Peoples Diſcontents, is not, that they at firſt diſliked the Preſent Government, but that they were diſap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pointed in their hopes of ſome Preferment that they thought themſelves beſt de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerved: and yet, God be thanked, I cannot ſee any great Injury that thoſe People can do to the Preſent Eſtabliſhment, ſince the King, Parliament and People are all of a ſide; and as for the Malecontents, they are neither Popular nor Conſiderable.</p>
            <p>There is a Story in <hi>Joſephus</hi> ſomething parallel to our Caſe; that was, <q rend="inline">The <hi>Jews</hi> were commonly very ſtrict in the obſervance of the Sabbath; and a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mongſt other Tenets of that nature, they held it unlawful ſo much as to defend themſelves, tho attackt by the Enemy on that Day; this their Ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mies came to the knowledge of, and put them upon the trial, cutting a great many to pieces; which made the reſt grant that it was lawful to ſtand upon their own defence, but not to preſs upon the Enemy; and they met with a ſecond Diſadvantage upon that ſcore; but finding to their Coſt the folly of ſuch Conceits, it came at laſt to this, That when they were under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taken a third time out of hopes of like ſucceſs; they not only defended them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves, but defeated their Adverſaries moſt effectually.</q> This Story I apply thus: That notwithſtanding of late we have mixt Matters of Religion and Policy too much, and advanced the Arbitrary Power of Princes, by ſtretching the Doctrine of <hi>Paſſive Obedience</hi> beyond its due limits; yet let not our Ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſaries believe that we want either Hearts or Hands to opppoſe a Foreign or <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>nlimited Power, and that too without either departing from the Princi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ples of Religion, or ſo much as wavering in our Profeſſion. Let thoſe then then
<pb facs="tcp:98441:6"/> that will, be fond of the Garlick and Onions of <hi>Egypt;</hi> for my own part, I cannot ſee how we can make one ſtep backwards without the danger of being poiſoned by them: For certainly there are ſeveral Queſtions now in hand not to be reſolved by the Rules of our Church, but by our Legal Conſtitution, which in ſome Caſes binds the Eccleſiaſtical it ſelf. And for all that ſpecious Ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jection which ſome People make, That our Laws, as well as our Religion, are againſt the Depoſing Doctrine; Yet it will endure no ſerious thought, That God has made ſo many Millions of People to be ſubject to the Humour or Intereſt of any one particular Man. For whatever has been ſaid to the contrary of late, it's both agreeable to the Principles of Reaſon and Religion, that <hi>Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lus populi ſuprema Lex.</hi> Government no doubt is <hi>Jure Divino,</hi> of which if we were deſtitute, <hi>nil ſane brutis amantibus praeſtaremur</hi> (ſays <hi>Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lanction</hi>); but then it's not neceſſary to have it terminated in this or that In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dividual; for tho it's an undoubted Truth, that any private perſon had better ſuffer Injuries, than hazard the publick Peace of his Country, by endeavouring to redreſs the ſame; and it cannot be lawful for every one to fly in the face of Authority, when he's injured, or at leaſt thinks himſelf ſo; yet neither the Laws of Nature, Reaſon, or Religion, oblige us to ſit ſtill, and ſee the Fun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>damental Conſtitutions of our Country overturned, without any indeavour of ours to obſtruct it: And tho there may be danger in endeavouring to ſtem ſuch a Tide, yet I may go further, and ſay, That thoſe People do not deſerve good Laws, but rather are the Betrayers of them, that dare not ſtand up in their juſt defence. <note place="margin" type="runSum">Meaſures of Obedience.</note> We know that the Apoſtle bids us <hi>ſubmit to every ordinance of man for the Lord's ſake,</hi> and that <hi>there is no Power but of God;</hi> but he doth not tell us, that either Tyranny, Slavery, or Oppreſſion, are from God, but that we may reſiſt them for his ſake, as well our own; and certainly if the uſurping an abſolute Power above, and againſt all Laws, be not Tyranny, the ſeizing mens Freeholds, contrary to all Juſtice and Equity, be not Oppreſſion, and the ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king ones Will the Law, in a Government which the wiſeſt of men call <hi>Limited,</hi> he not reducing people into Slavery, I know not what ſuch things mean. For in ſuch a caſe, it is not the Law of a Countrey that depoſes a Prince, nor the Religion that juſtifies it, but 'tis his own Act and Deed; for if the pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſenting to the People be but a Ceremony; yet, a Coronation Oath is not; and if a Prince can raiſe what Storms he pleaſes in his Dominions, without en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dangering his own Veſſel at the ſame time, them ſuch conſequences muſt un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>avoidably follow, as make all other people actually his Slaves, not Sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jects; but ſure the greateſt Privilege of an <hi>Engliſh</hi> man is to have the Law on his ſide, and his Religion by that Law made a part of his Property, which is a Bleſſing that few other Nations can boaſt of; and one main Rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon why this has been continued ſo long to us, whilſt other people groan under
<pb facs="tcp:98441:7"/> the Yoke of Arbitrary Power, is, Becauſe we have the Sea between us and any Foreign Enemy, and conſequently no pretence for a ſtanding Army, in times of peace, to defend our Frontiers againſt any ſudden Invaſion. An Army, no doubt, in times of peace, being the next ſtep to Slavery: To ſay nothing of Inconveniencies by this means brought into private Families, and the general Encouragement it gives to all ſorts of Vice. So that upon the whole matter, one ſhould think, that none would be fond of King <hi>James,</hi> or his Government: unleſs they reſolve at the ſame time, with the Burgers of <hi>Mons,</hi> to receive the <hi>French</hi> Gariſons, and afterward become their eternal Slaves.</p>
            <p>As to what I have ſaid in the following Account of the Affairs of <hi>Ireland,</hi> I can affirm it to be true in the main, tho poſſibly I may be miſtaken in ſome Circumſtances: Nor do I pretend to write a compleat Hiſtory of the War; That I leave to men of better Judgments, and more happy Opportunities; ſo that if this prove not advantagious, yet I hope it will produce what may, by inviting ſome more skilful hand to undertake the work, nothing of this kind being as yet abroad, except ſome little Pamphlets writ at random, by thoſe, that (it ſeems) never ſaw that Nation. I have not writ the leaſt Sentence out of prejudioe to any man; but if any have affected the Profit more than the Duty of their Employments, and think themſelves hinted at, in ſome ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neral Expreſſions; I have only this to ſay, That as I would not flatter, ſo I am not of ſuch a temper, as to fear any man, ſo far as to prevent me from ſpeaking Truth; nor can I (as I hope) be blamed by any but thoſe, who, having done ill themſelves, take it not well to be told of it: But let even thoſe examine their own Actions impartially, and they'll find I have been as ſparing in my Expreſſions as I well could, and not conceal the matter of Fact, which a great many know the truth of as well or better than my ſelf; and I am far from doing any man that injuſtice, as to charge him directly with a Crime, that I am not very well aſſured is due to him.</p>
            <p>What I have ſaid about the management of the <hi>Iriſh</hi> Army, is not barely our own Accounts, but what I got from ſeveral of their Officers, either Priſoners, or Deſerters, or by other Opportunities, as deſign or chance brought me to them.</p>
            <p>I pretend no importunity of Friends for the publiſhing of theſe Papers; for I am not ſo vain as to think they deſerve it: However, I hope they will ſatisfie ſome, who have not yet had opportunities to know theſe things; and if this Account may be any way ſerviceable to them, I ſhall be glad of it; if not, they muſt e'en have patience till a better appear. As to the mixing ſome ſmall matter of Hiſtory with the reſt, I did it becauſe it pleaſed a particular Friend, tho my time will not allow me to do it in ſuch a Method and Stile as the Dignity of the Subject requires.</p>

About fifteen or ſixteen years ago the <hi>French</hi> King ſent a great part of his Fleet to the relief of <hi>Meſſina,</hi> and ſome other places in <hi>Sicily,</hi> which ſome then lookt upon as a Blemiſh in his Politicks; and yet it appears ſince, that this was none of the leaſt depths of them; for by this, and ſuch like means, he has got now a good Fleet, and expert Sea-men.</p>

               </note> The Party marched according to Orders, and the whole Army followed about Six of the Clock: But on our march, the Duke had an account by one Mr. <hi>Humphreys</hi> of <hi>Belfaſt,</hi> That the Enemy had retreated, and Burnt the Town; the General then went forwards, and found the Flames not quite extinguiſhed; and with Coll. <hi>Leviſon</hi>'s Dra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>goons, and ſome of the <hi>Iniskillin</hi> Horſe, he went at leaſt two miles further, but nothing of an Enemy appearing, he returned, and gave Command for his Army to encamp a mile ſhort of <hi>Newry.</hi> The bad weather had diſturb'd us before, but now the Rains and Wind were ſo extreamly violent, that it was very difficult for us to pitch our Tents; ſo that every one was forced to ſhift for himſelf as well as he could; Proviſions were alſo very ſcarce, for there wanted Hor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes to bring them after us. We encampt here next day alſo; from whence the Duke ſent a Trumpet to the <hi>Iriſh,</hi> to let them know, That if they burnt any more Towns, he would give no Quarter.

               </note> moſt of them that I obſerved, had Croſſes on the Inſide, above the Doors, upon the Thatch, ſome made of Wood; and others of Straw or Ruſhes, finely wrought; ſome Houſes had more, and ſome leſs: I underſtood afterwards, that it
<pb n="14" facs="tcp:98441:14"/> is the cuſtom among the Native <hi>Iriſh,</hi> to ſet up a new Croſs every <hi>Corpus Chriſti</hi> day; and ſo many years as they have lived in ſuch a houſe, as many Croſſes you may find; I asked a Reaſon for it, but the Cuſtom was all they pretended to: Here the Corn alſo was either lying, and rotting on the ground, or elſe was ſhaken by the violent winds, for the People were all gone, the Proteſtants the <hi>March</hi> before, and the <hi>Iriſh</hi> now, at the retreating of their Army, ſome fled for fear, and thoſe that had a mind to ſtay, were forced away by the Army, with all their Cattel, and whatever elſe was portable. In the Evening the Duke ſent a Detachment of 520 Foot, with a Party of Horſe and Dragoons (commanded by my Lord <hi>Lisburn</hi>) towards <hi>Dundalk;</hi> they got there the next morning, but found it forſaken by the Enemy, and not burnt; tho it had been better for us if it had, as it fell out afterwards.</p>
            <p>There is an old ſquare Tower in <hi>Newry,</hi> which they call the Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtle, this was left ſtanding, and not above five or ſix Houſes more; the Town it ſelf had been a pretty place, and well built, ſtanding upon a very advantageous Paſs, the Tide coming up above the Bridge, by a Bay that comes from <hi>Carlingford.</hi> In this Caſtle the <hi>Iriſh</hi> had left ſome ſalt Beef and Herrings, but they were ſalted ſo very much after the <hi>Iriſh</hi> faſhion, that the Soldiers, for all they were very hard put to it for Victuals, yet they could not eat them; (I believe the greateſt reaſon was, a fond conceit they had got amongſt them, that the meat was poiſoned:) There was alſo a ſmall Gun left in the Caſtle, and another Twelve-Pounder thrown over the Bridge into the River. In this Caſtle the General left Fifty men of Sir <hi>Tho. Gowers</hi> Regiment, commanded by Captain <hi>Pallifer;</hi>

The detached Par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty of the Enemy that we heard was gone beyond the Mountains, went to a place call'd the <hi>Blackbank;</hi> and hearing that my Lord <hi>Hew<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>et</hi>'s Regiment of Horſe, and Sir <hi>Henry Ingleby</hi>'s Foot were march<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to the Camp, and were in <hi>Newry,</hi> or hard by it that night (though they came not thither till the next) as alſo ſome <hi>French</hi> Detachments that the Duke had commanded in, lay in <hi>Newry,</hi> be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſides the uſual Gariſon of Fifty Men; they came no further that way, but ſtruck off to the left towards <hi>Sligo;</hi> whenas its very pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bable, That if our Enemies had been all men of Reſolution, they might have ſent part of their Army in our Rear; and whilſt we endeavour'd to oppoſe thoſe, they might with the reſt have forced our Camp, and deſtroy'd us; but Providence was our beſt Guard. We had ſent ſeveral men ſick to <hi>Carlingford</hi> by this time. I hapned to be there that day, and we had News that the Enemy had taken <hi>Newry,</hi> and were upon their march to <hi>Carlingford;</hi> this was not be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieved by us; but however, the <hi>Iriſh</hi> that remained there, thought it true: and 'twas very obſervable with what Joy the Little Boys, as well as the ſilly Old Women, received the News, running toge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther,
<pb n="22" facs="tcp:98441:18"/> and whiſpering; nor was it poſſible for them to conceal their inward ſatisfaction. As I went to the Camp that Evening, I ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerved a ſmall Party of Light Horſe croſs the Rode a litte before me in great haſte; and when I got about a mile further, I under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtood that they were a Party of the <hi>Iriſh</hi> that had killed five <hi>French men,</hi> and two <hi>Iniskilliners,</hi> as they were a foraging towards the Mountains. <note place="margin" type="runSum">Great Rains.</note> This Afternoon came the firſt of our Ships up to <hi>Dun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dalk,</hi> from <hi>Carlingford,</hi> with Ammunition and Proviſions: In the Night the Rains were extreamly violent, and both Horſe and Foot had orders to forage towards <hi>Carlingford,</hi> for the Forage was de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtroy'd on the other ſide.</p>

               <hi>Saturday</hi> the 21ſt, About Nine a Clock in the Morning (it being a very clear ſunſhine-day) our Camp was alarmed; the Enemy diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>play'd their Standard-Royal, and all drew out, both Horſe and Foot, bringing along a very handſome Field-Train. A great Bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy of their Horſe drew up to the South-Weſt of the Town, about half a mile from our Out-works; the Duke went out to obſerve them, and ſent for Collonel <hi>Beaumont</hi>'s Regiment, into the Tren<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ches beyond the Town, and about an hour after for Collonel <hi>Earls.</hi> It was reported, that ſeveral great Officers were for fighting, and deſired the Duke to ſend for the Horſe home, who were moſt of them gone a foraging as far as <hi>Carlingford;</hi> but his Anſwer was, <hi>Let them alone, we will ſee what they will do.</hi> He received ſeveral freſh Accounts that the Enemy advanced, and always bid, <hi>Let them alone.</hi> A Body of their Foot came to the ſide of a Bogg, and fired upon a Party of our Horſe, not far from the Duke; but they knew the Horſe could not come at them, elſe, I ſuppoſe, they would ſcarce have come ſo near. Then our Gunners ſent from the Works, to ſee if they might fire amongſt the Enemy; who, by this time were within Cannon ſhot, but the Duke would not ſuffer it, except they came within Muſquet-ſhot of our Trenches. He obſerved the Enemies motions and poſtures, and ſaid, He ſaw no ſign of their deſigning to fight; only-once they drew their Army into two lines, as if they would, and then he ſent Lieute<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant-General <hi>Douglaſs</hi> to the Camp, to order all the Foot to ſtand to their Arms; and ſent to the Horſe, That upon the firing of three Pieces of Cannon, they ſhould return to the Camp, but till then to go on with their Foraging. Mean time the Duke, as if there was no fear of danger for all this (for he uſed to ſay, That it was not in their power to make him fight but when he pleaſed) alight<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
<pb n="23" facs="tcp:98441:18"/> from his Horſe, and ſate him down upon a little Hill, where he ſeem'd to ſleep for ſome time, though I believe his thoughts were at work how to repulſe the Enemy, if they ſhould attack him. Lieutenant-General <hi>Douglaſs</hi> came to the Camp, and all the Soldiers, with the greateſt joy in the World, ſtood to their Arms; ſeveral that had not ſtirr'd out of their Tents for a Week before, now got up their Muſquets, and all were glad to think that they had an opportunity of beating their Enemy (for they never ſuppoſed the contrary) and ſo to march forwards from that ſad place, which they begun already to be very weary of.</p>
            <p>
               <note place="margin" type="runSum">But refuſed by the Duke.</note> We ſtood looking upon one another for ſome time, and moſt peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple deſired that they might march through the Town, and have a fair Tryal for it; but the Duke had no ſuch thoughts; and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore he did not ſo much as ſend for his Horſe home; beſides, he knew that the Enemy could not eaſily force our Camp without a great deal of hazard to themſelves, and that he believed they would ſcarce be brought to. And therefore about two a Clock, when the Enemy begun to draw off, the General ſent orders for the Sol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diers to return to their Tents. My Lord <hi>Lisburne,</hi> and Collonel <hi>Woolſley</hi> made ſome proffers to beat the Enemy back; or with one thouſand men to beat up their Guards that night; but this was not ſo eaſy a Task as they made it; and the Duke refuſed it, conſider<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing if they did it, the Honour was theirs; but if they miſcarried, the diſadvantage was his. As the Enemy retired, a Party of Collo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nel <hi>Leviſon</hi>'s Dragoons killed about four or five of them, and ſome of the <hi>Iniskillin-men</hi> ſtript themſelves, and purſued the Enemy, kil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling two or three more, tho ſome of themſelves fell in the attempt; but the Action of that day was very inconſiderable; for neither could they come at us, nor we go to them, without ſuch diſadvan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tages, as are to be well conſidered of in ſuch caſes: And that the General acted this day, as well as before and after, according to the Rules of Art and Prudence, and that too for the beſt, may partly appear towards the latter end of the Campaign.

My Lord <hi>Hewett</hi>'s Horſe, and Sir <hi>Henry Inglesby</hi>'s Foot came this day to the Camp (the lat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter being relieved at <hi>Carigfergus</hi> by Collonel <hi>Guſtavus Hambleton</hi> from <hi>Cheſter</hi>) and two <hi>French</hi> Granadeers were apprehended as they were going to the Enemy. <note place="margin" type="runSum">A Plot diſco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver'd.</note> But next Morning there was a fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther diſcovery made: And firſt, Four Soldiers and a Drummer, then Sixteen more apprehended; ſeveral Letters were found about ſome of thoſe; as one to Monſieur <hi>d'Avaux,</hi> and, as they ſay, one to the Late King; thoſe it ſeems were writ by one <hi>Du Pleſſey,</hi> who ſerved as a private Soldier in <hi>M.

            <p>
               <hi>Monday</hi> morning the Enemy came and burnt all the Forage that was left between our Camp and theirs (the General would not ſend out a party for fear of an Ambuſcade) and the Soldiers ſeem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed to be pleaſed with it, becauſe, they ſaid, they could not get leave to fight them. The Weather for two or three days proved pretty fair, and the Soldiers were exerciſed with firing at Marks; but it was obſervable, that a great many of the new men who had Match-Locks, had ſo little skill in placing of their Matches true, that ſcarce one of them in four could fire their Pieces off; and thoſe that did, thought they had done a feat if the Gun fired, never minding what they ſhot at.</p>

<pb n="26" facs="tcp:98441:20"/> and the <hi>Iniskillin</hi>-Foot to Draw into a Line to the Right of our Works, at the Weſt-end of the Town, where they made three Running-fires, which were anſwered by the <hi>Iniskillin-Horſe</hi> from their Camp, and by the Great Guns upon our Works, as alſo from our Ships that lay in the mouth of the River.

            <p>The 28th, The Officers were acquainted it was the King's poſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tive Orders, that the Soldiers ſhould not be wronged in their Pay, nor neglected; and whoſoever was careleſs of his Company, ſhould be broke without Ceremony (that was, I ſuppoſe, without a Court Martial): Care was likewiſe commanded to be taken of the Sick, at <hi>Carlingford.</hi> An Officer was ſent out of every Regiment, to look after them, and ſee them paid; but for all this, a great many of them died miſerably, and ſeveral Officers did not take the care that was neceſſary; nor was there either Drugs, or indeed Chy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rurgeons to look after the Sick.

Sir <hi>Edward</hi> was very much lament<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed in the Army by all that knew him: He left a good Fortune in <hi>England,</hi> purely to ſerve the King in this Expedition, as did three more of his Brothers, one of which <hi>(viz.)</hi> Capt. <hi>John Deering</hi>
               <pb n="30" facs="tcp:98441:22"/> died ſince at <hi>Taudrogee,</hi> being a very ingenious young Gentle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man. </p>
            <p>On the 17<hi>th</hi> a Party of <hi>Inniskillin</hi> Horſe, and ſome of <hi>Leviſon</hi>'s Dragoons, were got ſo nigh the Enemy, that a Party of twenty Horſe came behind them, thinking to keep a Paſs, whilſt others charged them in the Front; <note place="margin" type="runSum">Four Iriſh Men killed.</note> but our Men diſcovering their Error, faced about, and charged thoſe in the Rear, whereof they killed four, and took ſix Priſoners. <note place="margin" type="runSum">A Prieſt hanged for a Spy.</note> The ſame day a Prieſt was hanged, who came from the Enemy as a Deſerter, but proved a Spy; he ſerved then in ſtation of a Captain.

            <p>The 20<hi>th</hi> Capt. <hi>Withers</hi> of Maj.

Thoſe that were alive, ſeemed very ſorry when the others were to be buried, not that they were dead, (for they were the hardeſt-hearted one to another in the World) but whilſt they had them in their Huts, they either ſerved to lay between them and the cold Wind, or at leaſt were ſerviceable to ſit or lie upon. And ſince the Ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>my were now drawn off, the Guards were taken from the Ships, and from <hi>Mortimer</hi>'s Caſtle, leaving only a Sergeant and twelve Men at the Gate that leads to <hi>Bedloes</hi> Caſtle; and becauſe ſome Companies were ſo thin, that there were ſcarce twelve healthful Men in them; it was therefore ordered, that every Company ſhould do Duty according to ſtrength.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Tueſday</hi> the 22<hi>d,</hi> great part of the Army were marched be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>yond the Town and encamp'd, ſome towards <hi>Bedloe</hi>'s-Caſtle, and ſome down towards the Shipping, in ſo much that thoſe that

An Officer was ſent to take care of them, and was to call on Mr. <hi>Shales</hi> for Proviſions: Eve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry Officer was to ſee that none were ſent on Board but what were really Sick, and this was recommended to the Colonels as well as to the Brigadiers. This Afternoon there came a Drum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer from the Enemy about the Exchange of Priſoners. <note place="margin" type="runSum">Dutch Priſoners releaſed by King <hi>James.</hi>
               </note> And three Dutch-men were taken as they were ſtragling in the Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>try, who being brought to King <hi>James,</hi> and ask'd, Who they be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>longed to? when he underſtood their Captain was the ſame that had the Care of him formerly at <hi>Rocheſter,</hi> he diſmiſſed them, with his Service to their Captain, giving each of them ſome Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny, becauſe, he ſaid, their Captain had been formerly civil to him.</p>
            <p>The 23<hi>d</hi> ſeveral ſick Men having been ſent on Board, and not Ships enough for the reſt, Mr. <hi>Shales</hi> was ordered to bring more from <hi>Carlingford,</hi> and moſt of the Regiments went to encamp beyond the Town; I ſuppoſe the General was of Opinion the Ground whereon we lay was infected, or elſe he would not have removed us out of our Huts into our Tents again, eſpecially in ſuch boiſterous Weather.</p>
            <p>
               <note place="margin" type="runSum">A Trumpeter comes about the exchange of Priſoners.</note> The 24<hi>th</hi> there was a Trumpeter ſent alſo about the Exchange of Priſoners: And it was ordered that the Officers ſhould give an Account of their effective Men, how many Sick, and where; as alſo of their ſpare Arms, and deliver them in to the Artil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lery, taking a Receipt for them; but what Arms were broke or loſt, the Captains were to be accountable for; and it was but reaſonable: nor did the Officers take that due care in this parti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cular that was convenient; for if any Souldier is careleſs of his Arms, the Officer ought to puniſh him, by which the King will be both better ſerved, and freed from that unneceſſary Charge of ſupplying his Army anew every Year: but what with the Rain, and our own careleſneſs together, our Arms were often in that condition, that ſhould the Enemy have attaqued us on a ſudden, we had ſcarce one Muſquet in ten that was ſerviceable.</p>
            <p>The 25<hi>th,</hi> 26<hi>th,</hi> 27<hi>th,</hi> all the reſt of the Army removed through the Town, and encamp'd on freſh Ground; the Weather ſtill continued very bad, and great Numbers, both of Officers and Souldiers, died. The General then gave Orders that no

               <note place="margin" type="runSum">No Firings for the Dead.</note> Firings ſhould be for the Dead, becauſe it encouraged the Ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>my, who knew but too well our Condition, and yet could do us but little harm. Moſt People now began to murmur againſt the General, as if he had been the Cauſe of all their Misfortunes: but it is commonly a Fate incident to great Men, to be extreamly magnified upon Succeſs, and upon any notable Diſaſter to be as much reproach'd, and ſometimes neither juſtly, for he himſelf ſhared in the trouble of this Affair, but could not in reaſon be made the cauſe of it.</p>
            <p>On the 27<hi>th,</hi> about 12 a Clock at Night, 200 of Col. <hi>Leviſon</hi>'s Dragoons, a Party of <hi>Inniskilliners,</hi> and ſome French Horſe, were ſent towards the Enemies Camp, who went almoſt as far as <hi>Ardee,</hi> and brought back ſome Cattle and Horſes, took only a Serjeant Priſoner, and had a Lieutenant killed.</p>
            <p>Next Morning there was a Party of 80 Granadiers mounted and ſent abroad, commanded by Lieut. <hi>Laton;</hi> but theſe re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turned with the above-ſaid Party: and frequent Trumpets were ſent to and fro about the Exchange of Priſoners. This Even<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing about nine a Clock, died Sir <hi>Thomas Gower</hi> of a Feaver, as did alſo Col. <hi>Wharton</hi> next Morning, and were both buried on the 30<hi>th</hi> in one Vault, (where a in Fortnight before Sir <hi>Edward Deering</hi> was laid) the Regiments being joined, and fired three times by particular Order.</p>
            <p>Theſe two Gentlemen were very much bemoaned by the whole Army; Col. <hi>Wharton</hi> was a brisk bold Man, and had a Regiment that would have followed him any where, for they loved him, and this made him ready to puſh on upon all Occa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſions. Sir <hi>Tho Gower,</hi> though he was but juſt in a manner en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tring upon the World, yet I believe few or none of his Age could out-do him; he was of a quick and ready Wit, as well as a ſolid Judgment, and made it his Buſineſs to know Men and Things; to this was joined a very good Education, together with a moſt ſweet and affable Temper; being withal a Man of a comely and handſom Perſon, (as was alſo Col. <hi>Wharton</hi>) that it made him truly bemoaned by all that knew him. A day or two after died C. <hi>Hungerford,</hi> a very hopeful young Gentleman, and of a conſiderable Fortune; with ſeveral other Officers, and great numbers of Souldiers, (as I have ſaid:) And many unthink<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing Mens Paſſions led them to cenſure the General as the occaſion of all this. They would ſay, that if he had gone on at firſt, he
<pb n="33" facs="tcp:98441:23"/> might certainly have got <hi>Dublin,</hi> and what he did was only to protract the War, and that he cared not how many died, ſo he was well himſelf; but at beſt, that he was ſo old that he was not fit for Action, for if he had but rid out, he would forget in two or three hours that he had been abroad that Day. But all thoſe were moſt falſe and ignorant Suggeſtions, as his Majeſty was very ſenſible of at that time; and it appeared to all conſidering People to be ſo afterwards. For beſides, prime Miniſters are not to level their Proceedings to the Capacities of all who pretend Vigilancy and Care of the State, and no Man living in publick Imployments can manage ſo as to have the good word of all People, neither indeed is it convenient or rational to endeavour or expect it.</p>
            <p>On the laſt of <hi>October,</hi> all the Quarter-maſters had Orders to go on Board with each ten Men, and ſee the Ships cleared to make room for the Sick; they were all to have Tickets from their Colonels, and the Brigadeers were ordered to viſit them on Board: but if any were well enough to go to <hi>Carlingford,</hi> or the County of <hi>Down,</hi> they were to be taken care of; the Colo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nels, or Lieutenant-Colonels were to go with the Brigadier on Board, and every Adjutant was to give a Liſt next Morning of their Sick to the Adjutant-General, which was a very large one.</p>

               <pb n="34" facs="tcp:98441:24"/> For <hi>Sarsfield,</hi> with a conſiderable Body, coming that way, thoſe at <hi>James-Town,</hi> not thinking it tenable, quitted it, and marched to <hi>Sligo,</hi> loſing ſome of their own Party, and killing ſome of the <hi>Iriſh</hi> who preſt upon them in their Retreat. <note place="margin" type="runSum">
                  <hi>Sligo</hi> taken by the Iriſh.</note> 
               <hi>Sarsfield</hi> with his Army, next Day, came before <hi>Sligo,</hi> which made Colonel <hi>Ruſſel</hi> retreat to <hi>Balliſhannon,</hi> and he adviſed the Foot alſo to quit the Town. There was a French Captain, with the Detached Party of Granadeers that went from our Camp, and Colonel <hi>Lloyd</hi> with ſome <hi>Inniskilliners;</hi> theſe ſtaid in the Town, and from thence retreated to the two Forts at the end of it, <hi>Lloyd</hi> into one, and the French-man with his Granadeers into the other. Colonel <hi>Lloyd</hi> went away that Night, and loſt ſeveral of his Men in his Retreat: But the French Captain had carried in Proviſions, and found three Barrels of powder in the Fort. The Nights were dark, and he fearing the Enemy might make their Approaches to the Fort undiſcovered, he got a great many Fir-Deals, and dip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ping the Ends of them in Tarr, they made ſuch a Light, when ſet on Fire, and hung over the Wall, that he diſcovered the Ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>my coming with an Engine they called <hi>Sow;</hi> but having killed the Ingineer and two or three more, the reſt retired, and he burnt the Engine. When Day appeared, the Enemy were forced to quit a ſmall Field-piece they had planted in the Street, our Men plyed them ſo with Shot from the Fort; and then making a Sally ſeve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral of them were killed. But their Proviſions being gone, and there being little or no Water in the Fort, our Men ſurrendred it one the 3<hi>d</hi> Day upon Honourable Terms, <hi>viz.</hi> to march out with their Arms and Baggage. At their coming over the Bridg, Col. <hi>Sarsfield</hi> ſtood with a Purſe of Guineas, and proffered to every one that would ſerve King <hi>James,</hi> to give him Horſe and Arms with Five Guineas Advance; but they all made anſwer, <hi>that they would never fight for the Papiſhes</hi> (as they called them) except one, who next Day after he had got Horſe and Arms, and Gold, brought all off with him. So ſteadfaſt were the poor Men, in what they had undertaken, that tho they had indured a great deal of Hardſhip, yet would dye rather than be Faithleſs. There were ſeveral alſo that were taken Priſoners as they ſtragled from the Camp, or upon flying Parties; and tho they indured all the Miſeries of a ſevere Reſtraint, yet they could by no means be wrought upon to take up Arms againſt the Intereſt they had come thither to venture their Lives for: Nay even thoſe that
<pb n="35" facs="tcp:98441:24"/> were a dying in the Camp were wont to expreſs no other Sorrow, than <hi>Plague on theſe Papiſhes, that we muſt dye here and not have leave to go and fight them.</hi> The French Captain's Name, as I remember, was Monſieur <hi>de St. Sauvem,</hi> he died afterwards at <hi>Lisburn</hi> of a Feaverr. The Caſtle of <hi>Sligo</hi> is one of the moſt Ancient in <hi>Ire<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land,</hi> it was formerly the Seat of the <hi>O Connors,</hi> who would not for a great while yield to King <hi>Henry</hi> the Second, calling themſelves the Ancient Kings of <hi>Ireland.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>But to return from this Digreſſion. On <hi>Saturday</hi> in the Eve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning it was ordered that a Colonel and a Brigadeer ſhould go the Rounds, and ſtay in the Camp all Night, to ſee the Guards all right, to enquire what Officers lay out of the Camp, and to acquaint the General with it; and becauſe they found there was abundance of ſick Men that neither could march, nor was there Room for them in the Ships, therefore Waggons were or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dered to be ready at the Bridg-End next Morning to carry them all to <hi>Carlingford</hi> and <hi>Newry.</hi> The Colonels, Lieute<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant-Colonels and Majors of each Regiment were ordered to be there, and ſee their ſick Men taken care of, and to give them Money; there was alſo an Officer out of each Regiment ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pointed with a Guard to attend them.</p>
            <p>
               <note place="margin" type="runSum">A great many Sick.</note> Next Morning the poor Men were brought down from all pla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces towards the Bridg-End, and ſeveral of them died by the way, the reſt were put upon Waggons, which was the moſt Lamen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>table Sight in the World, for all the Rodes, from <hi>Dundalk</hi> to <hi>Newry</hi> and <hi>Carlingford</hi> were next day full of nothing but dead Men, who ever as the Waggons joulted, ſome of them died, and were thrown off as faſt. The General very ſeldom uſed to be from the Church, but that day he was for ſome hours at the Bridg-end, to ſee all the care taken for the Men that could be, and was very much diſpleaſed that all the Field-Officers were not ſo careful as he had given Command they ſhould. The Ships were then filling with Sick, and as many dying on that ſide: they were ordered to goe into <hi>Deep-water,</hi> and ſail with the firſt fair Wind for <hi>Belfaſt.</hi> The Weather all this while was very diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mal, and yet we were obliged to ſtay till both the Ships were got into <hi>Deep-water,</hi> and the ſick gone by Land, leſt when we were gone, the Enemy ſhould ſpoil our Ships, and kill our Men.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Monday</hi> the 4<hi>th</hi> of <hi>November</hi> it was ordered, that all who had any ſick Men on Board, ſhould ſend an Enſign with ten Men to

The Tents that were by the Water<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſide were to be taken on Board to keep the ſick Men warm, and every Regiment was to have the ſame number again that they brought thither.

            <p>The ninth Day the reſt of our Army marched from <hi>Dundalk,</hi> the Duke giving Orders firſt to burn ſome Arms and Proviſions that could not be got off, becauſe the Waggons were imployed to carry the Men; and ſome few ſick Men were left that could not be removed, thoſe were at the Mercy of the Enemy, who did not uſe them ill, but buried ſeveral that were dead.

            <p>I doubt not but moſt People will be curious to know how ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny died this Campaign, and in Quarters, and what could be the occaſion of ſuch Mortality; as likewiſe how many the Ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mies Numbers were when they lay ſo nigh us, and wonder why two Armies ſhould lie ſo near together (for our Front and theirs were for above a Fortnight not two miles aſunder) and yet ſo little of Action happen. <note place="margin" type="runSum">The Reaſons of our Mens dying.</note> As to the firſt, whatever the World may think, yet I can attribute thoſe Diſtempers amongſt us to nothing elſe but the Badneſs of the Weather, the moiſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs of the Place, the unacquaintedneſs of the Engliſh to hardſhips, and indeed their lazy Careleſsneſs: for I remember a Regiment of Dutch that Encamp'd at the end of the Town, were ſo well hutted, that not above eleven of them died the whole Campaign; but it's the ſame thing with the Engliſh when<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever you take them firſt out of their own Country as it was here: and let Men be in other things never ſo happy, if they have Courage, and know the uſe of their Arms, yet when they come upon Duty, if they have not Bodies inured to hardſhips, they lie under a great diſadvantage. But in truth we could ſcarce have been more infortunate either in a Place or in the Weather than whilſt we were there; for it would often rain all
<pb n="39" facs="tcp:98441:26"/> Day upon us when there was not one drop in the Enemies Camp; this they uſed to call <hi>a Judgment,</hi> but it was becauſe we lay in a Hollow at the Bottoms of the Mountains, and they upon a high ſound Ground: the Enemy did not at firſt die ſo faſt as we did, becauſe they were born in the Country, and were uſed to bad lying and feeding, but before they decamped they were nigh as ill as we, and abundance died after they got to Quarters.</p>
            <p>
               <note place="margin" type="runSum">Chirurgions ill provided.</note> One thing I cannot omit, and that is, that our Surgeons were very ill provided with Druggs, having in their Cheſts only ſome little things for Wounds, but little or nothing that might be uſeful againſt the Flux and the Feaver, which were the two raging Diſtempers amongſt us; and yet I cannot but think that the Feaver was partly brought to our Camp by ſome of thoſe People that came from <hi>Derry,</hi> for it was obſervable that after ſome of them came amongſt us, it was preſently ſpread over the whole Army, yet I did not find many of themſelves died of it.</p>

               <note place="margin" type="runSum">Number of Men that died at <hi>Dundalk.</hi>
               </note> As to the Number of our Men that died, I am ſure there were not above ſixteen or ſeventeen Hundred that died in or about <hi>Dundalk;</hi> but our Ships came from <hi>Carlingford</hi> and <hi>Dundalk</hi> about the 13<hi>th</hi> of <hi>November</hi> to <hi>Belfaſt,</hi> and there were ſhipt at thoſe two places 1970 ſick Men, and not 1100 of thoſe came a-ſhore, but died at Sea; nay, ſo great was the Mortality, that ſeve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral Ships had all the Men in them dead, and no Body to look after them whilſt they lay in the Bay at <hi>Carickfergus.</hi> As for the Great Hoſpital at <hi>Belfaſt,</hi> there were 3762 that died in it from the firſt of <hi>November</hi> to the firſt of <hi>May,</hi> as appears by the Tallies given in by the Men that buried them: There were ſeveral that had their Limbs ſo mortified in the Camp, and afterwards, that ſome had their Toes, and ſome their whole Feet that fell off as the Surgeons were dreſſing them; ſo that upon the whole matter, we loſt nigh one half of the Men that we took over with us.</p>
            <p>
               <note place="margin" type="runSum">The Enemies Numbers.</note> As to the Enemies Numbers, and the reaſon why ſo little Action happened; the Accounts that were given by Deſerters both as to the Enemies Numbers and Deſigns, were ſo various and diſagreeing, that the General himſelf was at a Loſs what to truſt to: (which, if well conſidered, will anſwer many of thoſe raſh Objections made to the management of that Campagne). I
<pb n="40" facs="tcp:98441:27"/> have ſeen a Liſt of their whole Army ſince; and the moſt agree that they had at <hi>Dundalk</hi> 17 Regiments of Horſe and Dragoons, with as many Foot as made them nigh forty thouſand, though their Foot were not all very well armed, but ſome had Scithes in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtead of Pikes: yet Lieut. General <hi>Hamilton</hi> denies that they were ever ſo many in the Field. And as for ſo little of Action hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pening in ſo long a time, the reaſon on the Duke's ſide (as I hum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bly conjecture) might be, that he found himſelf exceedingly out-done in the number of his Horſe: nor did the ſmall Body that he had, come all at one time, but ſtragling, by degrees: And therefore he was unwilling to venture a few, except he had e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nough to puſh for all, which he had not. And our entrenching our ſelves might make the Enemy think it was to no purpoſe to alarm us, ſince they believed it impoſſible to force our Camp, which it certainly was not, if we had had any other ſort of Peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple to deal withal but Iriſh. But it may be they conſidered that Maxim, that the Invader is ſtill to proffer, and the Invaded to decline a Battel.</p>

            <p>Theſe make in all (counting the Blew Battalion for one) thir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty Regiments of Foot; but thoſe were all that we had in <hi>Ire<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land;</hi> there were ſome at <hi>Derry,</hi> and Col. <hi>Hamilton</hi>'s Regiment at <hi>Carickfergus;</hi> ſome at <hi>Inniskillin,</hi> and others at <hi>Sligo</hi> (till the Iriſh took it from us.) Fifty Men were left upon a Party at <hi>Newry:</hi> There were alſo ſeveral killed at <hi>Carickfergus,</hi> and ſome left ſick and wounded at <hi>Belfaſt;</hi> beſides the two <hi>Hamiltons, Lloyd</hi>'s, <hi>White</hi>'s, <hi>St. John</hi>'s and <hi>Haſtings</hi>'s, never came to the Camp. Sir <hi>Henry In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>glesby</hi>'s and two Regiments of Horſe came not till our Camp was fix'd; and then Maj. Gen. <hi>Kirk</hi>'s, Sir <hi>John Hanmer</hi>'s, and Briga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dier <hi>Stuart</hi>'s Regiments had laid long on Ship-board, and had been haraſſed, ſo that they had loſt ſeveral of their Number. Some alſo were dead or ſick, and others run away. Put all theſe things together (I ſay) and we cannot ſuppoſe that the Duke had above 2000 Horſe and Dragoons, and not many more than 12000 Foot, when the Iriſh proffer'd him Battel.</p>
            <p>I have no warrant from any body for what I am going to ſay, only I think my ſelf obliged to give an account of what I am perſwaded is true, in anſwering thoſe Objections which were made by the Army firſt, and then by ſeveral of the People of <hi>England</hi> that had loſt their Relations or Friends, <hi>(viz.)</hi> That the
<pb n="42" facs="tcp:98441:28"/> Duke was to blame he did not go on at firſt without ſtopping, for then we had got <hi>Dublin,</hi> and all the Kingdom would have fal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>len of courſe, without half that expence of Treaſure that <hi>Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land</hi> has been at: And that we loſt more Men by lying at <hi>Dun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dalk,</hi> than we could have done in a Battel; and alſo a year's time which might have been employed with an Army in the Heart of <hi>France.</hi> Theſe things, and ſeveral of the like nature, have been objected to the Conduct of that Great Man, who always thought it better to owe his Victories to good Management than good Fortune; ſince wiſe Counſels are ſtill within the Power of wiſe Men, but Succeſs is not. And what Man in the World would be thought wiſe, and his Actions entertained as the beſt, if only ſuch were ſo, againſt whom and which no Objection could be made? The Memory therefore of ſuch a Man ought not to ſuf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fer, who all his Life-long had been ſaid to act with the greateſt Prudence in the World: And for his management in this Affair, no doubt he could give very ſubſtantial Reaſons, yet becauſe thoſe are not, nor cannot be known to the World, I ſhall only offer ſome few that I have had from very good Hands, and which I know in the main to be true. It's an eaſy thing for Men to ſit at home by a warm Fire-ſide, and find fault with Affairs of the greateſt Moment, tho they know no more than the Man in the Moon what ſuch things mean: and if we get but into a Coffee-houſe, or over a Bottle in a Tavern, we can be greater Stateſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men and Generals in opinion than thoſe that are really ſo; and can do that in conceit in two hours, which the greateſt Men find a difficulty to perform in ſome years. The Duke therefore I humbly conceive had more Reaſons for what he did than I can think on, or poſſibly ever heard of. But what I have to offer are theſe, as,</p>
            <p n="1">
               <note place="margin" type="runSum">The Reaſons why the General went no further than <hi>Dundalk.</hi>
               </note> 1. Where the Fault lay I know not, but I was at <hi>Cheſter</hi> when the Duke had been above a week in <hi>Ireland;</hi> and all or moſt of the Waggon-Horſes, and ſome of the Train-Horſes were there then: nor did they come over till we had been ſome time at <hi>Dundalk.</hi> The Country, as we marched, was all deſtroyed by the Iriſh; ſo that by that time we got to <hi>Newry,</hi> I was forced to go and dig Potatoes, which made the greateſt part of a Dinner to better Men than my ſelf: and if it was ſo with us, it may ea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſily be ſuppoſed that the poor Souldiers had harder times of it. This the Duke was very ſenſible of, and ſent for Mr. <hi>Alloway</hi>
               <pb n="43" facs="tcp:98441:28"/> Commiſſary to the Train, and told him that he muſt ſend back his Horſes for Bread for the Men: And when the other urged, it was a thing never known that the Train-Horſes were employ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed to any other Uſe than what belonged to the Train it ſelf; the Duke replied, He knew the truth of that; but that he had rather break any Rules than his Men ſhould ſtarve; and accord<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ingly ſome of the Horſes were ſent for Bread, as I have obſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved before.</p>
            <p n="2">2. For want of Horſes and Carriages the Duke was forced to ſhip the greateſt part of his Train, and ſeveral Neceſſaries for a Camp, at <hi>Carickfergus;</hi> and gave Orders that the Ships ſhould ſail with the firſt fair Wind for <hi>Carlingford</hi>-Bay: but though the Wind was very favourable, they did not ſtir in ten days after; nor did there any Ships come to <hi>Carlingford,</hi> till we had been at <hi>Dundalk</hi> at leaſt a week, and then only four came at a time. I have heard indeed that he who had the Sailing Orders, went ſome-where with them, and the Ships lay ſtill for want of them: but how true this is, I know not.</p>
            <p n="3">3. It was ſaid, that the General had aſſurance given him, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore he left <hi>England,</hi> that an Army ſhould be landed in the Weſt of <hi>Ireland,</hi> at his marching through the North, (and according<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly we had it ſeveral times affirmed that it was ſo:) This no doubt would have diſtracted the Iriſh, and made the Duke's Paſſage to <hi>Dublin</hi> much more eaſy. But the General had an ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>count I ſuppoſe that this could not be, and therefore he muſt ſtand or fall by himſelf. Nor would any that knew Duke <hi>Schon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bergh</hi> believe he would ever come abroad with ſo ſmall an Army, and ſo ill provided: And I have heard ſay, that that Army was never deſigned to conquer <hi>Ireland,</hi> but to defend the North.</p>
            <p n="4">4. It was no difficult thing for him to march his Army as far as <hi>Dundalk,</hi> and that ſafely, by reaſon the Country was full of Mountains and Bogs; and the Enemies Horſe could not do him much harm, (though if they had pleaſed, they needed not have let us come paſt <hi>Newry,</hi> and yet their Horſe had then newly come from <hi>Derry,</hi> and were gone to recruit.) But if he had paſs'd that Place, it was a plain and open Country, and we might eaſily have been ſurrounded, and our Communication both from the North and alſo from our Ships cut off: for if we paſt <hi>Dundalk,</hi> we could have no more benefit of our Shipping till we had been Maſters of <hi>Drogheda,</hi> or elſe have gone to <hi>Dub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lin,</hi>
               <pb n="44" facs="tcp:98441:29"/> and then we muſt have gone over the <hi>Boyne,</hi> which thrice our Number, and that too in a dry Seaſon in the midſt of Summer, found ſome difficulty in paſſing; and all this we muſt have performed in two or three days, or elſe have ſtarved.</p>
            <p n="5">5. Suppoſe that if we had marched on and made an halt at <hi>Dundalk,</hi> we might have gone to <hi>Dublin,</hi> the Iriſh Army not being got together, (for I have heard it was debated whether <hi>Drogheda</hi> ſhould have been ſurrendred if we advanced thither? and it was once carried in the Affirmative): But the Duke was not certain of the Enemies Condition; nor if he had, Would it have been any prudence to have gone on without Proviſions, without Ships, and a great many other things that were abſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lutely neceſſary? He knew he was ſafe at <hi>Dundalk,</hi> and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore he choſe to ſtay there and underſtand the poſture of the Enemy, and expect his own Things and Forces, rather than run the hazard of gaining that by meer Fortune, which if ſhe had frown'd, the Damage was certainly irreparable.</p>
            <p n="6">6. The General was a meer Stranger in the Country, and therefore he muſt look at a great many Things with other Mens Eyes, and ſome of thoſe were dim enough; nor had he any Counſel aſſigned him, but had the whole ſhock of Affairs upon himſelf, which was the occaſion that he ſcarce ever went to Bed till it was very late, and then had his Candle, with a Book and Penſil by him; this would have confounded any other Man, and was fit for no Body to undertake but Duke <hi>Schonberg,</hi> or his Maſter that employed him. Before the Duke could be ready therefore to march forwards, the <hi>Iriſh</hi> Army was come and ſat down by us, and then it was too late.</p>

               <note place="margin" type="runSum">And why he did not fight the Iriſh Army.</note> Nor do I think he was more to blame in refuſing Battel, when the <hi>Iriſh</hi> ſeem'd to proffer it; for though it's probable that the <hi>Iriſh</hi> at our firſt coming over, took our Numbers to be greater than they really were, yet by that time we had been a Week at <hi>Dundalk,</hi> they knew our Numbers and our Circumſtances as well as we our ſelves did, both by the Intelligence they had in the Country, and by ſeveral of the <hi>French</hi> that had a mind to betray us: For, all things conſidered, we had not above 14000 Horſe and Foot, and very few of thoſe Horſe; nor was the Duke to go according to our reputed Numbers, but to what we were in Reality. The Enemy had nigh four times our Num<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber

               </gap> Number of Foot: nor could we have drawn out upon them without a manifeſt diſadvantage, there being ſeveral Bogs and Cauſeys between us and them, that whoſoever gave the Attaque (all things elſe con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſidered) it was odds againſt them: Beſides, moſt of our Soul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diers were new Men, and had never ſeen a Sword drawn in An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger, nor a Gun fired in Earneſt in their Lives; and what ſuch Men will do till they be tried, there's none can tell. I believe the Men had as good Hearts, and were all as ready I am ſure to engage as was poſſible; but ſeveral of them were ignorant of the true uſe of their Arms, for when they came afterwards to fire at a Mark ſingly, they gave too great proof to any Man of ſenſe of their Unskilfulneſs. This is no Reflection upon the Officers, for it's ſcarce poſſible to make new-raiſed Men good Souldiers till they have ſeen ſome Action; and yet ſeveral Offi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cers might have taken more care than they did. If it be ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jected, that the Enemies Men were far worſe in this reſpect than ours; I anſwer: Not, for a great many of them had been Soul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diers for at leaſt four Years before: and if we had gone out in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to the Plain, and had our Foot charged by their Horſe at the rate we were afterwards at the <hi>Boyne,</hi> I know not what might have followed.</p>
            <p>Beſides, we had an Enemy in our Boſom at that time undiſco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vered, (I mean the <hi>French</hi>); and if thoſe at the beginning of an Engagement ſhould have fired in the Rear or Flank of our Army upon our own Men, and then run over to the Enemy as was deſigned, this might quickly have bred an appre<gap reason="illegible" resp="#OXF" extent="1 letter">

               </gap>henſion of Treachery in the whole, that a Conſternation, and from this ſuch a Confuſion, that our whole Army might eaſily have been diſordered; for thoſe that underſtand Armies, know that a ſmall thing in appearance may do a great deal of Miſchief at ſuch a time. And ſome are of Opinion that the <hi>Iriſh</hi> did not deſign to fight that Day, but only drew out to ſee who would come over to them, (becauſe they were made believe that all the <hi>French,</hi> and a great many <hi>Engliſh</hi> would) for the Duke, who was a great Judg, often ſaid, when he ſaw the Enemy appear, That <hi>they did not look as if they would fight, (except once) but that they deſigned ſomething elſe:</hi> But, God be thanked, the <hi>Engliſh</hi>
               <pb n="46" facs="tcp:98441:30"/> were ſtedfaſt and true to a Man, and they were diſappointed of their Foreigners too.</p>
            <p>Upon the whole Matter, I doubt not but it will appear to any Man that pleaſes to conſider it, that the Duke did better in not hazarding that in a moment, which may be was not to be redeemed again in many Ages, ſince not only the Safety of theſe Kingdoms did in a great meaſure depend upon it, but a great part of the Proteſtant Intereſt in <hi>Europe</hi> had a Concern in it. And where the Fates of Kingdoms, and the Lives and Intereſts of Thouſands are at Stake, Men are ſtill to act on ſolid Reaſons and Principles; the Turns of a Battel being ſo many, and are often occaſioned by ſuch unexpected Acci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dents, which alſo proceed from ſuch minute Cauſes, that a wiſe and great Captain (ſuch as Duke <hi>Schonberg</hi> was) will expoſe to Chance only as much as the very Nature of War re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quires.</p>
            <p>And as to what happened at <hi>Dundalk,</hi> by the Mens dying afterwards, this was not the General's Fault, for he could not march back till the Enemy was gone, (his Men then being ſo very weak, had all been cut off); nor could he foreſee what Weather it would be whilſt he ſtaid, nor how the <hi>Engliſh</hi> Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtitutions would bear it. And as to his Care that they ſhould want nothing, let any but conſider the Orders through the Camp, and he will find it was ſcarce in the power of any Man to do more.</p>
            <p>But I am affraid it will be thought impertinent, to indea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vour the defence of ſo great a Man's Actions, and to do it no better; <note place="margin" type="runSum">Former Misfor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tunes at <hi>Dun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dalk.</hi>
               </note> I only add therefore, that this Town of <hi>Dundalk</hi> has by turns been unfortunate to the People of the three Nations. It was in Time paſt a Town very ſtrongly walled, which <hi>Edward Bruce,</hi> Brother to the King of <hi>Scots,</hi> (who had Proclaimed him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf King of <hi>Ireland</hi>) burnt; but he was near this place after<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward ſlain, with 8200 of his Men.

            <p n="1">
               <note place="margin" type="runSum">Some of the Ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neral's Orders.</note> 1. That the Captain or Officer commanding each Company, meet at two a Clock at the Guard-Houſe each <hi>Tueſday</hi> to puniſh Offenders, and to conſider what may be for the Good of the Regiment, and that the Country have notice thereof, that if there be any Complaints againſt the Souldiers they may be heard.</p>

The Enemy had ſome notice of their coming, and ſeem'd to deſign fighting, but conſidered better of it, and ran away; 17 of them took to a Bog, in which were taken one Lieutenant <hi>Murphey</hi> and four more, one Man being killed only; our People brought home about 500 Cattel.</p>

               <hi>February</hi> the 8<hi>th,</hi> the General had an account that the Enemy were drawing down ſome Forces towards <hi>Dundalk,</hi> and that they had laid in great Store of Corn, Hay, and other Proviſions, in order to diſturb our Frontier-Gariſons from thence. The Duke ſent a Ship or two towards <hi>Dundalk,</hi> who burnt ſome of the Iriſh Gabbords: <note place="margin" type="runSum">The General draws ſome For<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces into the field.</note> But the Report of theſe Forces obliged the General to ſend a conſiderable Body of Horſe and Foot that way; and he himſelf, <hi>February</hi> the 11<hi>th,</hi> went towards <hi>Drummore,</hi> in or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der to wait the Enemies Motion. (It was very obſervable how much the Men and Horſes were now recovered from what they had been two months before.)</p>
            <p>Sir <hi>John Lanier</hi> and Col. <hi>La Millinier</hi> were ſent out with a Par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty, who went as far as <hi>Carlingford,</hi> and returned with an account
<pb n="54" facs="tcp:98441:34"/> that there were only 3 Regiments at <hi>Dundalk</hi> as formerly. But the Deſign of the Iriſh lay another way: for whilſt the Duke was upon this Expedition, Col. <hi>Woolſely</hi> had notice that the Iriſh had a deſign to fall upon <hi>Belturbet;</hi> to which purpoſe a conſiderable Number of them was come to <hi>Cavan,</hi> and more to follow in a day or two. Col. <hi>Woolſely</hi> to prevent them, marched from <hi>Belturbet</hi> with 700 Foot and 300 Horſe and Dragoons; he began his march in the evening, thinking to ſurprize the Enemy next morning early, (the diſtance between being about 8 miles;) but he met with ſo many Difficulties in his March, (and the Enemy had notice of his coming) that inſtead of being at the Place before day, as he deſigned, it was half an hour after day-break before he came in ſight of it; ſo that inſtead of ſurprizing them, the firſt thing our Men ſaw was a Body of the Enemy drawn up in good order, judged to be nigh 4000: this was ſevere, but there was no help for it, fight we muſt, for retreating was dangerous. Col. <hi>Woolſely</hi> encourages his Men, and tells them the Advantages of being brave, and the inevitable Ruin of the whole Party if they proved other<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe: they were as ready to go on as he to deſire it: And then he ſends an advance-Party of <hi>Inniskillin</hi> Dragoons towards the E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nemy, who were preſently charged by a great Party of the Ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mies Horſe, and beat back paſt the Front of our own Foot, who were ſo enraged at them, that ſome of M. G. <hi>Kirk</hi>'s and Col. <hi>Whar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ton</hi>'s Men fired, and killed 7 or 8: ſome of the Enemies Horſe purſued them ſo far, that many of them were kill'd by our Foot as they endeavour'd to get off. By this time the Body of our Par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty was advanced pretty near the Iriſh, who were poſted upon the Top of a riſing Ground not far from the Town: As our Men advanced up the Hill, the Iriſh fired a whoſe Volley upon them, and then ſet up the Huzzah, but ſcarce killed a Man, (for they ſhot over them;) our Men however went on till they were got within Piſtol-ſhot of them, and then fired, by which they galled the Iriſh ſo, that they immediately run towards the Town: We purſued, and they retired to a Fort; but Col. <hi>Woolſely</hi>'s Men fal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling to plunder in the Town, the Iriſh ſallied out, and gave us a very fierce Attack. Col. <hi>Woolſely</hi> having 250 Foot and about 80 Horſe for a Reſerve, the Enemy was beat off again, their Horſe flying beyond the Town, and their Foot taking to the Fort. Our Souldiers got good ſtore of Shoes, and all ſorts of Proviſions, and about 4000 pounds in Braſs Money, a great deal of which the Souldiers threw about the Streets as not thinking it worth the
<pb n="55" facs="tcp:98441:34"/> Carriage; their Ammunition was blown up, and their Proviſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons deſtroyed (for Col. <hi>Woolſely</hi> was forced to ſet the Town on fire to get his own Men out in the time of the Salley). The Colonel knew not what might happen, and therefore he drew off his Men, and marched homewards. The <hi>Iriſh</hi> they ſay were com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manded by the Duke of <hi>Berwick,</hi> who had his Horſe ſhot under him; and in two or three days they were to have 10000 Men at <hi>Cavan</hi> to fall upon <hi>Belturbet,</hi> and other places. The Enemy loſt in this Expedition, Brigadeer <hi>Nugent,</hi> and as they ſay <hi>O Riley,</hi> Governour of <hi>Cavan,</hi> with a great many Officers, and about 300 Souldiers.</p>
            <p>In this Action we loſt about thirty, with Maj. <hi>Traherne,</hi> Capt. <hi>Armſtrong,</hi> and Capt. <hi>Mayo,</hi> who were killed by purſuing too far; a <hi>French</hi> Reformed Officer, and Capt. <hi>Blood</hi> an Ingineer, were wounded. We took twelve Officers and about ſixty Soul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diers Priſoners, who were brought ſoon after to <hi>Carickfergus.</hi> I have ſpoke with ſeveral <hi>Iriſh</hi> Officers ſince, and they will not al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low their Loſs to be ſo great, or ours ſo little in this Action as we make them, yet give us the Advantage to a great degree.</p>
            <p>At the General's return to <hi>Lisburn,</hi> he received an Account from Col. <hi>Woolſely</hi> of this Action, much to the ſame effect as I have related it. <note place="margin" type="runSum">Sir <hi>John La<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nier</hi>'s Expedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion to <hi>Dun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dalk.</hi>

The Enemy had Fortified it very well, ſo that the Major-General did not think fit to attaque it, (nor do I believe he had any Orders to do it) he drew up his Foot however on the ſide of an Hill, between the left of our old Horſe-Camp and the Town, a good Muſquet-ſhot from the Bridg; his Horſe he ſent nearer, ſomewhat to the Right at the ſide of the Lane. The Enemy at the Allarm appeared without the Town at firſt; but as we ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vanced, they retreated, till they got within their Works, from whence they fired inceſſantly. Whilſt the main Body was ſo poſted, Maj. Gen. <hi>Lanier</hi> ſent a party of Horſe and Dragoons be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>yond the River, who burnt the Weſt part of the Town, from <hi>Mortimer-Caſtle</hi> to <hi>Blake</hi>'s Houſe, (being a great part of the Sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>urbs). At ſame time a Party of Col. <hi>Leviſton</hi>'s Dragoons attaqu'd <hi>Bedloe</hi>'s Caſtle, and took the Enſign that Commanded it, with 30 Priſoners; we loſt a Lieutenant and three or four Dragoons, and had four Horſes ſhot. Our Men brought from beyond the Town,
<pb n="56" facs="tcp:98441:35"/> and about it, nigh 1500 Cows and Horſes: The Enſign that was taken, was brought to <hi>Lisborn,</hi> and carried before the Duke into his Garden, where he commonly uſed to walk before Dinner: Before the Duke ask'd him any Queſtions, me-thought he gave him a pretty Caution to be ſincere in his Anſwers, (though the General knew at the ſame time, he being a Priſoner, was not ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liged to ſay any thing); <hi>You</hi> (ſays the Duke) <hi>have a Commiſſion, and for that reaſon (if not otherwiſe) you are a Gentleman; this obli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ges you to ſpeak Truth, which if you do not, I can know it by examining of other Priſoners, and then I ſhall have no good Opinion of you.</hi> After ſome publick Queſtions, the Duke took him aſide, and talk'd with him nigh half an hour; but I ſuppoſe he could, or at leaſt would ſay little that was material.</p>

            <p>The Articles being ſigned, a Truce was publiſhed, and the General ſent <hi>Robert Alloway</hi> Eſquire, Commiſſary of the Train, to take an Account of the Stores in the Gariſon; and all the next day the Country People were buying Goods from thoſe of the Gariſon; ſome of our Officers were invited in, and ſome of theirs came into our Camp. At the time appointed they marched out; and then drew up before the Gate, four Companies of Col. <hi>Babington</hi>'s Regiment marching in. Moſt of our Regiments that there-abouts were drawn up as the <hi>Iriſh</hi> marched along towards <hi>Armagh,</hi> being all well Clothed and Armed, which made the <hi>Iriſh</hi> a little out of Countenance to ſee it. The Colonel of the <hi>Brandenburgh</hi> Regiment ſeem'd very much concern'd, that he ſhould come ſo far to fight againſt ſuch Scoundrels as the
<pb n="62" facs="tcp:98441:38"/> 
               <hi>Iriſh</hi> ſeem'd by their Habits to be; ſome few of the Detachments being only as yet well clothed, though their Arms look'd well enough, and moſt of their Army had new Clothes afterwards.</p>
            <p>The General himſelf went that morning from <hi>Legacory</hi> to ſee the Caſtle of <hi>Charlemont;</hi> and after the <hi>Iriſh</hi> had marched about half a Mile from it, they drew up in two Battalions, (about 400 Men in each) and there ſtood, till the General came to ſee them; beſides the Souldiers, they had alſo above 200 <hi>Iriſh</hi> Women and Children, who ſtood in a Body by themſelves between the two Battalions. <note place="margin" type="runSum">A Deſcription of the Governor.</note> Old <hi>Teague</hi> the Governour was mounted upon an old Ston'd Horſe, and he very lame with the Scratches, Spavin, Ring-bones, and other Infirmities; but withal ſo vitious, that he would fall a kicking and ſqueeling if any Body came near him. <hi>Teague</hi> himſelf had a great Bunch upon his Back, a plain Red Coat, an old weather-beaten Wig hanging down at full length, a little narrow white Beaver cock'd up, a yellow Cravat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtring but that all on one ſide, his Boots with a thouſand wrin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cles in them; and though it was a very hot day, yet he had a great Muff hanging about him, and to crown all, was almoſt tipſy with Brandy. Thus mounted and equipp'd, he approached the Duke with a Complement, but his Horſe would not allow him to make it a long one, for he fell to work preſently, and the Duke had ſcarce time to make him a civil Return; the Duke ſmiled afterwards, and ſaid, <hi>Teague's Horſe was very mad, and himſelf very drunk.</hi> The General then viewed the <hi>Iriſh</hi> Battalions, who all, both Officers and Souldiers, (after they had made him a great many Legs) ſtared upon him as if they knew not whether he was a Man, or ſome other ſtrange Creature, for the <hi>Iriſh</hi> were generally wont to ask one another, <hi>what is that</hi> Shambear <hi>that all this talk is of?</hi> 
               <note place="margin" type="runSum">Of the Gariſon.</note> The Duke ſeeing ſo many Women and Children ask'd <hi>the reaſon of keeping ſuch a number in the Ga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riſon, which, no doubt, deſtroyed their Proviſions?</hi> He was anſwered, <hi>that the</hi> Iriſh <hi>were naturally very hoſpitable, and that they all fared alike;</hi> but the greateſt reaſon was, <hi>the Souldiers would not ſtay is the Garriſon without their Wives and Miſtreſſes.</hi> The Duke re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ply'd, That there was more Love then Policy in it: and after ſome ſmall time returned to the Caſtle, which he rid round, firſt without the Paliſado's, and then within the Rampart.</p>
            <p>
               <note place="margin" type="runSum">And of the Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtle.</note> The Place is very ſtrong, both by Nature and Art, being ſea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted upon a piece of Ground (not four Acres) in the middle of a Bog, and only two ways to come to it, which the <hi>Iriſh</hi> had
<pb n="63" facs="tcp:98441:38"/> partly broke down: They had alſo burnt and deſtroyed all the Country about it, being well inhabited formerly. The Town of <hi>Charlemont</hi> ſtood by the Caſtle, as we were told, but the <hi>Iriſh</hi> had ſo levelled it, that nothing remained to ſhow that ever there had been any ſuch thing; yet they had caſt up ſeveral Forts and Breaſt works to prevent our Approaches to the Caſtle, which of it ſelf is a very regular Fortification. It's firſt paliſado'd round, then a dry Ditch and Counterſcarp; within this a double Ram<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>part, and next a thick Stone-wall, with Flankers and Baſtions al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moſt every way; there are two Draw-bridges, and both well for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tified; and within all ſtood the Magazines, with a large ſquare Tower, where <hi>Teague,</hi> his Officers, and a great many of the Soul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diers dwelt. They had left no Proviſions in the Caſtle but a little dirty Meal, and part of a Quarter of muſty Beaf: And certain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly they were reduced to great Neceſſity, for as they marched a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>long, ſeveral of them were chawing and feeding very heartily up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on pieces of dried Hides, with Hair and all on. In <hi>Teague</hi>'s own Room I ſaw ſeveral Papers; amongſt the reſt a Copy of a Let<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter writ formerly to ſome about K. <hi>James,</hi> giving an Account of the State of the Gariſon; and withal, a very true Relation of our Proceedings in ſeveral things, which ſhewed they wanted not In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>telligence. One thing tho was falſe, for there it was ſaid, that the <hi>Creights,</hi> by coming down, and taking Protections from the Ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neral, had furniſhed us with Cattle and Proviſions, when as we were ready to ſtarve before. But that was an <hi>Iriſh</hi> Fancy, for ſeveral of the <hi>Creights</hi> came down, and would have ſtaid; but we ſent them back becauſe they brought nothing with them; and as to our ſelves, we were well ſupplied, either from the Stores, or from the Country.</p>
            <p>There were two Prieſts in the Gariſon, and there happened a pleaſant Adventure between one of them and a Dragoon of Col. <hi>Hefford</hi>'s Regiment, as they were guarding the <hi>Iriſh</hi> towards <hi>Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>magh:</hi> they fell into Diſcourſe about Religion, the Point in hand was <hi>Tranſubſtantiation;</hi> the Dragoon being a pleaſant witty Fel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low, drolled upon the Prieſt, and put him ſo to it, that he had little to ſay: upon which he grew ſo angry, that he fell a beat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the Dragoon; but he not being uſed to Blows, thraſh'd his Fatherhood very ſeveraly. Upon which complaint being made to <hi>Teague</hi> as he was at Dinner with our Officers at <hi>Armagh;</hi> all that he ſaid was, <hi>That he was very glad of it, What te Deal had he to do to diſpute Religion with a Dragoon?</hi> The Duke ordered every one
<pb n="64" facs="tcp:98441:39"/> of the <hi>Iriſh</hi> Souldiers a Loaf out of the Stores at <hi>Armagh;</hi> and the Officers were all civilly entertained, which made them go away very well ſatisfied with the General, and highly commending our Army. There were in the Caſtle 17 Guns, moſt of which were Braſs, one large Mortar-piece, Bombs, Hand-Granadoes, Match, and ſmall Bullets a great quantity; as alſo 83 Barrels of Powder, with a great many Arms, and other things of uſe.</p>
            <p>I know a great many blamed the Duke for not taking this Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtle before he went to <hi>Dundalk,</hi> for then he might have had it for asking; however, it was not good to leave it behind him; but it's a miſtake, for the <hi>Iriſh</hi> had then a good Gariſon in it, and the General could not at that time divide his Army, nor yet whilſt he lay at <hi>Dundalk</hi> was it ſafe to endeavour it.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Charlemont</hi> was built by Sir <hi>Charles Blunt</hi> Lord Deputy of <hi>Ire<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land,</hi> who in Q. <hi>Elizabeth</hi>'s Time had ſeveral Skirmiſhes with <hi>O-Neal</hi> Earl of <hi>Tirone</hi> in this Country, and built this Fort a little below a former One that was called <hi>Mount-Joy,</hi> and this he called after his Chriſtian Name <hi>Charlemont.</hi> It was afterwards improved by the preſent Lord <hi>Charlemont</hi>'s Grand-father, and ſold to the King, as being a Place of Strength and Conveniency to keep the Northren <hi>Iriſh</hi> in their Duty. It ſtands upon the <hi>Black-water,</hi> which runs from thence to <hi>Port-a-down,</hi> where in 1641 a great many Proteſtants were drowned by the <hi>Iriſh.</hi>

                  <hi>Bellingargy</hi> taken.</note> The ſame day that <hi>Charlemont</hi> was ſurrendered, Col. <hi>Woolſely</hi> went with a Party of 1200 Men to a Caſtle called <hi>Bellingargy,</hi> in which the Enemy had a Gariſon of above 200 Men. This was ſeated in a great Water, ſo that our Men muſt wade up to the middle to come at it. Col. <hi>Foulks</hi> commanded the Foot, and marched at the Head of them through the Water. The Enemy fired and killed us ſeveral Men; however they ſaw we were reſolved to have it; and ſo after ſeveral Faſcins brought to fill up the Ditches, and ſmart firings on both ſides, they hung out their white Flag, and agreed to march away without their Arms. Col. <hi>Woolſely</hi> going down to encourage the Men, was ſhot in the <hi>Scrotum,</hi> but ſoon recovered. We had 17 Men killed, 43 wounded, beſides two Captains and an Enſign killed.</p>

Theſe Men ordered all the Proteſtants Goods to be ſeized, that were fit for Traffick, and ſent to <hi>France.</hi> The late King pretended to pay them the half value in Braſs Mony, but that was ſcarce ever got; and often if a Man was known to have Mony, he was ſent to Goal under pretence of High-Treaſon. Col. <hi>Simon Lutteril</hi> was Governor of <hi>Dublin.</hi> As to the Churches, the late King ſeemed to incline to continue Proteſtants in them; but what en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deavours he made to reſtore Churches in the Country, they were fruſtrated; ſometimes under pretence that the King had no Power in thoſe Matters (and ſome ſay he never deſign'd they ſhould) and therefore his Orders were not to be obeyed, or elſe his Clergy had not ſo eaſily diſſwaded him from performing what he had promiſed, except in the Buſineſs about the Church of <hi>Limerick,</hi> wherein he obſerved, that when it was for the purpoſe of the Papiſts to have the Proteſtants turned out of Town, then they were very numerous, and conſequently dangerous; but when the contrary anſwered their Ends, as in the Inſtance of deſiring the Church of <hi>Limerick,</hi> then the Proteſtants were made very few, which he took notice of, and the Proteſtants at <hi>Limerick</hi> keep the Cathedral all this while. They gave an account alſo that our Churches were generally ſhut up, upon any Alarm from Sea, or Report from the Army, and the Proteſtants impriſoned.</p>
            <p>As to the Military Affairs, they gave an Account, that the <hi>French</hi> about 5000. Men, came to <hi>Dublin</hi> ſome-time after their landing, being well armed and clothed. Soon after, the poſſeſſion of the Town and Caſtle were given to <hi>Lauzun,</hi> whom the <hi>French</hi> ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>knowledged to ſerve, and not K. <hi>James;</hi> and they were generally at free Quarter upon the Proteſtants; nor would Monſieur <hi>Lau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zun</hi> ſet his Guards in Town till he had poſſeſſion of the Caſtle.

Thoſe and ſeveral other things they gave an Account of, firſt to the Duke, and afterwards to the King.</p>
            <p>Towards the latter end of <hi>May</hi> we had ſeveral ſmall Parties that went abroad, one to <hi>Finnah,</hi> and another to <hi>Kells,</hi> bringing off Horſes, Cattel, and ſome Priſoners.

They had fortified <hi>Dundalk</hi> laſt Winter very regularly and well, not, I ſuppoſe, that they did deſign to maintain it in the Spring, but to ſecure the Garriſon from any attempts that we might make during the Winter: As we went through the Town we found ſeveral of the <hi>Iriſh</hi> that lay dead and un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>buried, and ſome were alive, but juſt only breathing.

            <p>The King was always upon Action; He obſerved the Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>try as he rid along, and ſaid it was worth Fighting for, and ordered the manner of Encamping that day himſelf: After that, with a ſmall party, His Majeſty before He eat or drank rid about four miles further towards the Enemy. As the Army was marching through <hi>Ardee,</hi> a <hi>French</hi> Soldier hap'ned to be very ſick with drinking Water, and deſpairing to live, pluckt out his Beads and fell to his Prayers; which one of the <hi>Danes</hi> ſeeing, ſhot the <hi>French</hi> Man dead, and took away his Muſquet, without any further Ceremony. There were none of the <hi>Iriſh</hi> to be ſeen but a few poor ſtarved Creatures who had ſcraped up ſome of the Husks of Oats nigh a Mill, to eat inſtead of better Food. It's a wonder to ſee how ſome of thoſe Creatures live; I my ſelf have ſeen them ſcratching like Hens amongſt the Cindars for Victuals; which put me in mind of a ſtory that I
<pb n="73" facs="tcp:98441:43"/> have read in the Annals of <hi>Ireland,</hi> where it is ſaid, that in the year 1317. the <hi>Ulſter</hi> Iriſh roved up and down the Kingdom in a Body, whilſt the Scots Army was down towards <hi>Limerick,</hi> and thoſe people were ſo hunger-ſtarved at laſt, that in Church-yards they took the Bodies out of their Graves, and in their Skulls boild the Fleſh and fed thereupon, and women did eat their own Children for hunger, ſo that of ten thouſand, there re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mained at laſt only three hundred, the reaſon of this plague the Superſtition of thoſe Times attributed to their eating of fleſh in Lent, for which this Curſe came upon them.</p>

            <p>By this time our Horſe were advancing a pace, and the E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nemy we could diſcern were all in a hurry, to get up their Horſes, which were many of them at Graſs, and to ſet all things in order; his Majeſty ſent out ſeveral parties of Horſe, ſome to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards the Town of <hi>Drogheda,</hi> and ſome towards the paſs at <hi>Old Bridge,</hi> and then rid ſoftly along weſtward, viewing the Enemies Camp as he paſſed, he made a little ſtop towards ſome old Houſes and every one commended mightily the order of our Horſe marching in, here it was that the Enemy fired their firſt Guns, from a Batterey of ſix Canons, that they had a good way be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low, but they did no hurt; two of our Troopers, went to the very Ford, and took away an Horſe, as alſo a Barrel of Ale that the <hi>Iriſh</hi> had been taken over.</p>

            <p>When the Enemy ſaw their great Shot diſturbed us, they ſet up a moſt prodigeous ſhout all over the Camp, as if our whole Army had been undone, and ſeveral Squadrons of their Horſe drew down upon a plain towards the River, but in ſuch a place as they knew it was impoſſible for us to come at them, the Ri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver being very deep and a Bank of nigh ten yards high on our ſide. I have often obſerved the <hi>Iriſh</hi> very fond of ſhouting and Hallowing before an Engagement, and there is a Tradition amongſt them, that whoſoever does not Shout and Huzzah as the reſt do in Battle, he's ſuddainly caught up from the ground

            <p>The King went to change his Coat, and get his ſhoulder dreſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed, and then rid about to ſee his Army come in, which were all this while marching, and encamping in two Lines. And here I cannot but take notice of a ſignal peice of Providence in the preſervation of the Kings Perſon, for whatever ill effects it might have had for the future, it would have been of fatal conſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quence to the Army at that time, if he had fallen, ſince inſtead of our going to them, the Iriſh would have been ready to have come to us next morning, and how we would have received them there's none can tell. I have met with ſeveral that will not believe, that the King was touched with a Canon Bullet at all, and if ſo, that it was impoſſible it ſhould not kill him, but I was preſent when the thing hapned, and therefore can affirm the truth of it. I have ſeen a great many odd accidents in wounds with Canon Bullets, and yet the Parties live, particularly one of my Lord <hi>Drogheda's</hi> Men, who had all the Fleſh of his right Cheek ſhot from the bone without breaking his Jaw, and he's yet alive and very well.

               <hi>Tueſday</hi> the firſt of <hi>July</hi> 1690. The day was very clear, as if the Sun it ſelf had a mind to ſee what would happen; about ſix a Clock, Lieutenant General <hi>Douglas</hi> marched towards the Right with the Foot, and Count <hi>Schonberg</hi> with the Horſe, which the Enemy perceiving, drew out their Horſe and Foot towards their Left, in order to oppoſe us: <note place="margin" type="runSum">Our Right wing draws out.</note> the Right wing at firſt were ordered to paſs all at <hi>Slane,</hi> but being better inform'd, ſeveral Regiments were Commanded to paſs at other Fords between our Camp and that place. As ſome of our Horſe marched to the River, there ſtood a Regiment of the Enemies Dragoons (ſent thither over night) nigh the Bank on the other ſide who fired upon us, and then thought to have retreated to their main Body, but before they could do that, they were flanked in a Lane, and about ſeventy of them cut off; we met with little more oppoſition in paſſing the River but marching forwards we found the Enemy drawn up in two lines: we had then twenty four Squardons of Horſe and Dra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>goons, with ſix Battalions of Foot, thoſe being too few, Lieu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tenant general <hi>Douglas</hi> ſent for more Foot, and in the mean time we drew up in two lines alſo, my Lord <hi>Portland</hi> adviſing
<pb n="79" facs="tcp:98441:46"/> for the more ſecurity to mix our Horſe and Foot, Squadron with Battalion; (this is no new way of managing, but was firſt practiced by <hi>Caeſar</hi> at the Battle of <hi>Pharſalia</hi> againſt <hi>Pompey,</hi> for he there quite altered the manner of embattleing amongſt the <hi>Romans,</hi> covering one of his Flanks with a ſmall River, and then placing ſeveral Battallions of his beſt Foot amongſt his Squadrons in the other, by which he ſoon routed <hi>Pompeys</hi> Horſe, and then falling into the Flanks, and Rear of his Enemy, ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tained the Victory.) However more Foot coming up, our great Officers altered the firſt Figure, and drew all the Horſe to the right, by which they outflanked the Enemy conſiderably. But as our men were advanceing, they met with a great deal of difficulty in the Ground, for there were large Corn Fields, with great Ditches, and thoſe very hard to be got over, (eſpecially for the Horſe, who were obliged to advance in order, when they were in the face of an Enemy,) and beyond all thoſe, there was ſuch a Bogg, as few of our men ever ſaw before; the Horſe tho' went to the right of it, but the Foot being Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manded to march through, found it as great an hardſhip as Fighting it ſelf, yet when the Enemy ſaw our men take the Bog, inſtead of charging them in it, they retreated in haſt towards <hi>Duleek,</hi> which Count <hi>Schonberg</hi> ſeeing, fell in amongſt their Foot with his Horſe and kill'd a great many.</p>
            <p>The King did not know of this diſadvantage of Ground, but computed the time when he thought our right wing was got well over, and then he ordered his Foot to attack the paſs at <hi>Old Bridge;</hi> during all which a great part of the Enemies Horſe and Foot were ſtill marching towards <hi>Slane,</hi> (where every one expected the main Battle would be,) and in their march, our Canon plaid continually upon them, yet tho we kill'd ſeveral it did not diſorder their Trops. The blew Dutch guards poſt being to the right, they were the firſt that took the River at <hi>Old Bridge:</hi> The <hi>Iriſh</hi> had lined the Houſes, Breaſtworks, and Hedges beyond the River, with my Lord <hi>Tyrconnels</hi> Regiment of Foot Guards, and ſome other Companyes; they had poſted alſo ſeven Regiments of Foot, about 150 yards backwards, who ſtood drawn up behind ſome little hills, to ſhelter them from our Canon, which played all this while, beſides theſe, were 2 Troops of Guards, 4 Troops of my Lord <hi>Tyrconnels,</hi> and 4 Troops of <hi>Parkers</hi> Regiments of Horſe, poſted in the ſame manner, (tho if
<pb n="80" facs="tcp:98441:47"/> they had poſted the <hi>French</hi> here inſtead of the <hi>Iriſh</hi> it would have been more to their advantage, but the reaſon of this was, the <hi>Iriſh</hi> Guards would not loſe the poſt of Honour.) <note place="margin" type="runSum">The <hi>Dutch</hi> Guards take the River.</note> The <hi>Dutch</hi> beat a march till they got to the Rivers ſide, and then the Drums ceaſing, in they went, ſome eight or ten a breaſt, being preſently almoſt up to the middle in the Stream (for they ſtopt the Current by their ſudden motion, and this made it deeper than uſual) the Enemy did not fire till our Men were towards the midſt of the River, and then a whole peal of Shot came from the Hedges, Breaſt-works, Houſes, and all about, yet we could not perceive any fall except one, and another ſtagger'd; he that was formoſt was a Lieutenant of Granadeers, who as he got footing on the other ſide, drew up two files of men, then ſtoopt, and they fired over him at the next hedge, which was not fifteen yards from them, at which fire thoſe in the Hedge quitted it, which the reſt ſeeing, all left their Poſts, and were followed with a Volley of Shot from our men that were Advancing. <note place="margin" type="runSum">And are charg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed by a Squa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dron of Horſe.</note> The <hi>Iriſh</hi> Foot run ſcattering into the next Field, and before the <hi>Dutch</hi> could get well over, and draw up, they were charged very bravely by a Squadron of the <hi>Iriſh</hi> Horſe, who came down in a full carreer, but were quickly beat off again. One would have thought that Men and Horſes had riſen out of the Earth, for now there appeared a great many Battalions and Squadrons of the Enemy, all on a ſuddain, who had ſtood behind the little Hills. We had two <hi>French</hi> Regiments, and Collonel St. <hi>John</hi>'s, who paſſed the River near the ſame time the <hi>Dutch</hi> did, but about 100 Yards below; which Lieutenant-General <hi>Hambleton</hi> perceiving, (who commanded at the Paſs) he Advanced with a party of Foot to the very River, and him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf with ſome others went into it, giving orders at the ſame time for my Lord <hi>Antrim</hi>'s Regiment, and ſome more, to go and Flank Sir <hi>John Hanmer</hi> and Count <hi>Naſſaw</hi>'s Regiments, who were paſſing about 200 Yards further down; but neither would his men ſtand by him, nor could the other be perſwaded to come near <hi>Hanmer:</hi> however, as <hi>Hambleton</hi> retreated a Sqa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dron of their Horſe charged our <hi>French</hi> ſo bravely, that about forty of them broke quite through Monſieur <hi>La Callimot</hi>'s Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>giment, and wounded himſelf mortally: thoſe muſt go back the ſame way, or elſe paſs through the Village and ſo wheel to the Left, to recover their own Men; they choſe the latter,
<pb n="81" facs="tcp:98441:47"/> but were ſo paid off by ſome of the <hi>Dutch</hi> and <hi>Inniskillin</hi> Foot, that not above ſix or eight of them got beyond the Village, moſt of their Horſes ſtragling up and down the Fields.</p>
            <p>
               <note place="margin" type="runSum">Our Foot Ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vance beyond the River.</note> The <hi>Dutch</hi> and the reſt of our Foot advanced all this while, and then the <hi>Iriſh</hi> Foot quitted a ſecond Hedge that they were perſwaded to rally to; another Body of Horſe came down upon the <hi>Dutch,</hi> who neglected the Hedges and met them in the open Field, but keeping ſo cloſe that it was impoſſible to break them; but as the <hi>Iriſh</hi> came on, the <hi>Dutch</hi> begun to fire by Platoons, and both flanked and fronted the Horſe, by which they killed a great many (though not without ſome loſs to themſelves) before this party drew off: <note place="margin" type="runSum">Are Charged again.</note> By this time ſome of the <hi>French</hi> and <hi>Inniskilliners</hi> were got into the Field, from whence the Enemy diſturb'd us with their Canon the day before, and then a freſh Squadron of Horſe coming down upon the <hi>Dutch,</hi> thoſe two Regiments ſtopt them, and obliged them to Retreat with conſiderable loſs. Much about this time there was nothing to be ſeen but Smoak and Duſt, nor any thing to be heard but one continued Fire for nigh half an hour; and whilſt this Action laſted, another party of the <hi>Iriſh</hi> Horſe Charged Sir <hi>John Hanmer</hi> as he paſſed the River, (nigh a place where the Enemy the day before had a Bat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tery of ſix Guns, but now they were gone, as was moſt of their Artillery:) It was the Duke of <hi>Berwick</hi>'s Troop of Guards; and as they advanced, one that had been formerly in Sir <hi>J. Hanmer</hi>'s Regiment came out ſingly and called one of the Captains by his name; who ſtepping towards him, the other fired both his Piſtols at him, but was taken Priſoner: this Troop was beat off again with the loſs of only three of Sir <hi>John Hanmer</hi>'s Men.</p>
            <p>All our Horſe went over to the Right and Left except one Squadron of <hi>Danes,</hi> who paſſed the River whilſt our Foot were engaged, and Advancing to the Front, <hi>Hambleton</hi> ſent out ſixty Horſe, who charged the <hi>Danes</hi> ſo home that they came faſter back again than they went, ſome of them ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver looking behind them till they had croſſed the River again. The want of Horſe was ſo apparent at this place, that the very Country People cry'd out Horſe, Horſe; which word going towards the Right, and they miſtaking it for <hi>Halt,</hi> ſtopt the Right Wing nigh half an hour; which time, well ſpent,
<pb n="82" facs="tcp:98441:48"/> might have done ſervice. This and the <hi>Iriſh</hi> breaking through the <hi>French</hi> Regiment hap'ned much about a time; <note place="margin" type="runSum">The General killed.</note> which, I am apt to believe, was the occaſion of Duke <hi>Schonberg</hi>'s go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing over ſo unſeaſonably, for in this hurry he was killed near the little Village beyond the River: the <hi>Iriſh</hi> Troopers as they rid by, ſtruck at him with their Swords; and ſome ſay that our own Men Firing too haſtily, when the Duke was before them, ſhot him themſelves; however it was, his mortal wound was through his Neck, and he had one or two cuts in the Head beſides, he fell down and did not ſpeak one word; and Cap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain <hi>Foubert</hi> was ſhot in the Arm as he was getting him off; Doctor <hi>Walker</hi> going, as ſome ſay, to look after the Duke, was ſhot a little beyond the River, and ſtript immediately; for the <hi>Scotch-Iriſh</hi> that followed our Camp were got through already, and took off moſt of the Plunder.</p>
            <p>This Action begun at a quarter paſt Ten, and was ſo hot till paſt Eleven that a great many old Soldiers ſaid they ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver ſaw brisker work: but then the <hi>Iriſh</hi> retreated to a riſing Ground, and there drew up again in order, both Horſe and Foot, deſigning to Charge our Party again that had paſt the River. Whilſt this Action at the Paſs laſted, the Left Wing of our Horſe (conſiſting of <hi>Danes</hi> and <hi>Dutch,</hi> with Collonel <hi>Woolſley</hi>'s Horſe and ſome Dragoons) paſſed the River at a very difficult and unuſual place: And the <hi>Daniſh</hi> Foot, with Collonel <hi>Cutts</hi>'s and ſome others, went over a little above them. My Lord <hi>Sydney</hi> and Major-General <hi>Kirk</hi> went from one place to another, as the poſture of Affairs required their preſence. <note place="margin" type="runSum">His Majeſty paſſes the Ri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver with the Left Wing.</note> His Majeſty, during thoſe Tranſactions, was al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moſt every where; before the Action begun He rid between our Army and theirs with only one Dragoon, and had or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dered every thing in other places as well as poſſible, He paſſes the River with the Left Wing of His Horſe, and that with as much difficulty as any body, for His Horſe was Bogg'd on the other ſide, and He was forced to alight till a Gentle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man helpt him to get His Horſe out. As ſoon as the Men were got upon the other Bank, and put in order, His Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jeſty drew His Sword (which yet was troubleſome to Him, His Arm being ſtiff with the Wound He received the day be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore) and marched at the Head of them towards the Enemy, who were coming on again in good order upon our Foot
<pb n="83" facs="tcp:98441:48"/> that had got over the Paſs, and were Advancing towards them, though they were double our Number; but when theſe two Bodies were almoſt within Muſquet ſhot of one ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, the Enemy eſpied the Left Wing of our Horſe march<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing towards them, at which they made a ſuddain Halt, faced about, and ſo retreated up the Hill to a little Church and a Village called <hi>Dunore,</hi> about half a mile from the Paſs; our Men marched in order after them; and at this Village the Enemy faced about and Charged; our Horſe were forced to give Ground, though the King was with them: His Majeſty then went to the <hi>Inniskilliners</hi> and askt what they would do for Him? and Advanced before them; their Officer told his Men who it was, and what Honour was done them: <note place="margin" type="runSum">And Charges ſeveral times at the Head of his Men.</note> At the Head of thoſe Men the King received the Enemies Fire, and then wheeling to the Left, that His own Men might have liberty to Advance and fire, they all wheeled after Him and retreated above 100 Yards; the King then went to the Left, to put Himſelf at the Head of ſome <hi>Dutch</hi> that were Ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vancing; and the <hi>Inniskilliners</hi> being ſenſible of their miſtake, came up again, doing good ſervice: ſome of Duke <hi>Schon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>berg</hi>'s <hi>French</hi> Horſe were here alſo, who behaved themſelves well, and took one or two of King <hi>James</hi>'s Standards. Ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther party, Commanded by Lieutenant-General <hi>Ginkel,</hi> Char<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ged in a Lane to the Left, but the <hi>Iriſh</hi> being two many for them they retreated; which a party of Sir <hi>Albert Cunningham</hi>'s Dragoons, commanded by his Lieutenant-Collonel, and ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther of Col. <hi>Leviſon</hi>'s, commanded by Captain <hi>Brewerton,</hi> per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiving, the Officers ordered their Men to alight and Line an Hedge, as alſo an old Houſe that Flankt the Lane, from whence they poured in their Shot upon the Enemy. Lieute<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant-General <hi>Ginkel</hi> ſtaid in the Rear of his Men, (being much vext at their retreating) and was in ſome danger by our own Dragoons; for the Enemy being cloſe upon him, they could not well diſtinguiſh; however the Dragoons did here a piece of good ſervice in ſtopping the Enemy, (who came up very boldly;) and our Horſe Rallying both here and to the Right, after near half an hours diſpute the Enemy were again beat from this place, and a great many of them killed. Lieute<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant-General <hi>Hambleton</hi> finding his Foot not to anſwer his expectation, he put himſelf at the Head of the Horſe, and

When he was brought to the King, His Majeſty asked him, Whether the <hi>Iriſh</hi> would fight any more? Yes, (ſaid he) an't pleaſe Your Majeſty, up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on my Honour I believe they will, for they have a good Bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy of Horſe ſtill. The King lookt a little aſide at him when he named his Honour, and repeated it once or twice, <hi>Your Honour?</hi> Intimating (as He always ſays a great deal in few words) that what the other affirmed upon his Honour was not to be believed, ſince he had forfeited that before in his ſiding with my Lord <hi>Tyrconnel;</hi> and this was all the Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>buke the King gave him for his breach of Truſt. There were ſeveral other priſoners taken here alſo, but not many of note.</p>
            <p>
               <note place="margin" type="runSum">How things went to the right of our Army.</note> Now, you muſt know, that whilſt all this hap'ned here, our Men on the Right were making their way as well as they could over Hedges, and Bogs towards <hi>Duleek,</hi> and as they Advanced the Enemy drew off, till they heard what had hap'ned at the Paſs, and then they made greater haſte, yet they could not retreat ſo faſt but ſeveral of them were killed, eſpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cially of their Foot, amongſt whom a party of our Horſe fell in; but they preſently ſcatter'd amongſt the Corn and Hedges till they got beyond a great Ditch, where our Horſe could not follow. Collonel <hi>Leviſon,</hi> with a party of his Dragoons, got between ſome of the Enemies Horſe and <hi>Duleek</hi> and killed ſeveral, yet if they had not minded retreating more than fight<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing he might have come off a loſer. When moſt of them were over the Paſs they drew up and fired their great Guns upon us; and we ours upon them, though we could not ea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſily come at them with our ſmall Shot, (for there are ſeveral Boggy Fields with Ditches at <hi>Duleek,</hi> and in the midſt of theſe a deep ſtrait Rivulet, very ſoft in the bottom and high Banks on each ſide, there is only one place to get over, and there not above ſix can go a breaſt.)</p>
            <p>Their confuſion, however, was ſo great that they left a great many Arms, and a conſiderable quantity of Ammuniti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on in that Village of <hi>Duleek,</hi> and, indeed, all the Country over; but our Men were ſo fooliſh as to blow up the Pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der wherever they met with it, and few or none of the Men eſcaped that came in their Hands, for they ſhot them like
<pb n="85" facs="tcp:98441:49"/> Hares amongſt the Corn, and in the Hedges as they found them in their march.</p>
            <p>
               <note place="margin" type="runSum">Reaſons why ſo few killed.</note> By that time therefore a Body of our Horſe was got over the Paſs, that was ſufficient to Attack the Enemy, they were gone at leaſt a mile before, their Horſe and Artillery in the Rear, and their Foot marching in great haſte and confuſion; we went after them for at leaſt three miles, but did not offer to Attack them any more, becauſe of the Ground. Then night coming on, the King, with ſome of the Horſe, return'd to the Foot that were Encamping at <hi>Duleek;</hi> but the greateſt part of them remained at their Arms all night, where they left off the purſuit.</p>
            <p>
               <note place="margin" type="runSum">The Number of the dead.</note> On the <hi>Iriſh</hi> ſide were killed my Lord <hi>Dungan,</hi> my Lord <hi>Car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lingford,</hi> Sir <hi>Neal O Neal,</hi> with a great many more Officers; they loſt at the Paſs, at <hi>Dunore, Duleek,</hi> and all the Fields ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>joyning, between 1000 and 1500 men; one thing was obſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vable, that moſt of their Horſe-men that charged ſo deſpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rately were drunk with Brandy, each man that morning having received half a Pint to his ſhare; but it ſeems the Foot had not ſo large a proportion, or at leaſt they did not deſerve it ſo well.</p>
            <p>On our ſide were killed nigh four hundred. The Dutch Granadeers told me, before we got to the Church at <hi>Dunore,</hi> that they had loſt ſeventeen, and the reſt proportionably; the <hi>French</hi> alſo loſt ſeveral, but all this was nothing in reſpect of Duke <hi>Schonberg,</hi> who was more conſiderable than all that were loſt on both ſides; whom his very Enemies always called a Brave Man, and a Great General. I have heard ſeveral reaſons given for the Dukes paſſing the River at that juncture: but, doubt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſs, his chief deſign was to encourage the <hi>French,</hi> whom he had always loved, and to rectifie ſome miſtakes that he might ſee at a diſtance: However 'twas, this I'm certain of, that we ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver knew the value of him till we really loſt him, which often falls out in ſuch caſes; and ſince it was in our Quarrel that he loſt his life, we cannot too much Honour his Memory, which will make a conſiderable Figure in Hiſtory whilſt the World laſts. He was certainly a Man of the beſt Education in the World, and knew Men and Things beyond moſt of his time, being Courteous and Civil to every Body, and yet had ſom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing always that lookt ſo Great in him, that he commanded reſpect from men of all Qualities and Stations. Nor did we
<pb n="86" facs="tcp:98441:50"/> know any fault that he had, except we might be jealous he ſometimes was too obliging to the <hi>French:</hi> As to his perſon, he was of a middle ſtature, well proportion'd, fair complexi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on'd, a very ſound hardy man of his age, and ſate an Horſe the beſt of any man; he loved conſtantly to be <gap reason="illegible" resp="#OXF" extent="1+ letters">
                  <desc>•…</desc>
               </gap>at in his Clothes, and in his Converſation he was always pleaſant: he was fourſcore and two when he died, and yet when he came to be unbowelled, his Heart, Intrails and Brain, were as freſh and as ſound as if he had been but twenty; ſo that it's pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bable he might have lived ſeveral Years, if Providence had not ordered it otherways. Monſieur <hi>Callimot,</hi> an honeſt wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thy Gentleman, died ſoon after him of his Wounds, having follow'd that great Man in all his Fortunes.</p>
            <p>Some who pretend to more skill than poſſibly they are really Maſters of, will needs affirm, that there were two overſights committed at this time; one in not purſuing the Enemy cloſſer after they were once broke, which had been leſs hazardous, conſidering all things then what followed af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terwards; my Lord of <hi>Oxford</hi> and my Lord <hi>Portland</hi> were for ſending three thouſand Horſe, with each a Muſqueteer be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hind him, to fall upon them in the Rear as they retreated, which might have done great matters; for the Enemy were in ſuch a Conſternation that they marched all that night in great fear and confuſion, expecting us at their Heels every mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nute. But thoſe that have ſeen the Ground at <hi>Duleek,</hi> and thereabouts, will ſay that it's ſcarce poſſible to make an order<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly purſuit at ſuch a place; for whilſt an Enemy continues in a Body, there's no going after them as if Men were a Fox-hunt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, ſince nothing encourages, even a flying Enemy more to rally and fight again, than to ſee a diſorderly purſuit of them: The Paſſes therefore were ſo narrow and troubleſome, that be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore we could get over a Body of Men, ſufficient to attack the Enemy, they were got a mile or two before us, and new dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficulties between us and them: nor was the caſe the ſame with them, for they got over any where as well as they could, ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cept the Rear, who kept their order as far as we could ſee them. As for his Majeſty himſelf, he choſe the Field, drew up his Army, gave his General Orders to his Officers, and the beſt Orders wherever he was in Perſon; but the greateſt Captain that ever was, or will be, is not, nor can be, of himſelf ſuffici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ent,
<pb n="87" facs="tcp:98441:50"/> to redreſs all Diſorders, or lay hold on all Advantages in an inſtant, when Armies are once ingaged. And further, his Majeſty having committed a conſiderable part of his Orders to the care of his General, the death of him muſt needs be a diſadvantage to the whole Army.</p>
            <p>Another thing they pretend to find fault with was, in not ſending ten thouſand Men immediately from the <hi>Boyne</hi> to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards <hi>Athlone</hi> and <hi>Limerick,</hi> ſince we were as nigh thoſe places here as at <hi>Dublin;</hi> and if we had gone behind them, <hi>Limerick</hi> and <hi>Galloway</hi> would certainly have yielded, for it was at leaſt a fortnight before any number of their Army got thi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, and then (they ſay) the <hi>Iriſh</hi> Army muſt either have fought again in the Field or elſe ſubmitted, ſince <hi>Dublin</hi> is not to be kept by thoſe that are not Maſters of the Field.

And before he was aſſur'd of it, the News of the <hi>French</hi> Fleets ſucceſs at Sea, altered both his and the <hi>Iriſh</hi> Peoples meaſures; for this put them into heart again, eſpecially when it came with a report (ſpread a broad, I ſuppoſe, on purpoſe) that King <hi>William</hi> was dead, as well as Duke <hi>Schonberg,</hi> and that the Dauphin of <hi>France</hi> was landed with an Army in <hi>England.</hi> But though there was little of Truth in theſe reports, yet they ani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mated the <hi>Iriſh,</hi> (who of all men living are the ſooneſt diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>couraged, but up again with the leaſt hopes,) and to work they went in making proviſions to defend their Towns, eſpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cially beyond the <hi>Shannon;</hi> but this I'm afraid will be thought impertinent, at leaſt it's out of order, and therefore to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turn.</p>

About nine a Clock King <hi>James</hi> came to <hi>Dublin,</hi> with about two hundred Horſe with him, all in diſorder.

<pb n="89" facs="tcp:98441:51"/> never had an Army a better opinion of a King, than ours of him, their only fear was that he would expoſe himſelf too far, and whatever difference happens between him and them can be only this, that they deſire to ſtand between his Majeſty and all danger, But he alwayes has a mind to put himſelf be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween them and it, may we long therefore have ſuch a Ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neral in a King, and he not only Souldiers, but Subjects of all profeſſions, that love him as well.

               <note place="margin" type="runSum">Two Spies taken.</note> The party that was ſent out brought in a great prey of Cat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle from the Enemies Quarters, and took two Spies with Let<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters from <hi>Athlone;</hi> one was, to Adviſe one <hi>Tute</hi> to Defend an Iſland nigh <hi>Mullingar,</hi> in which he had ſtore of Horſes, and ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veral things of value; Another Letter was from an Officer at <hi>Athlone,</hi> to his Father in the Country, telling him, that my Lord <hi>Tyrconnel,</hi> the Duke of <hi>Berwick,</hi> and ſeveral more great
<pb n="100" facs="tcp:98441:57"/> Officers were come to <hi>Limerick</hi> with a good Body of Horſe, and that all their Army would be there in two or three days, ſo that they would make either a Hog or a Dog on't, (as he expreſt it) That the <hi>Dauphin</hi> was landed in <hi>England</hi> with a great Army; that the <hi>French</hi> had beat the <hi>Engliſh</hi> and <hi>Dutch</hi> Fleets; that Duke <hi>Schonberg</hi> was dead; and it was ſaid the Prince of <hi>Orange</hi> was ſo too; that their King was gone for <hi>France,</hi> but it was no great matter (he ſaid) where he was, for they were better without him. Then he adviſed his Father not to take a Protection, becauſe thoſe that did were lookt upon as Enemies. And after his Letter was ſealed, he had writ on the out-ſide, <hi>Juſt now we have an Account, by a Gentleman that's come to us from</hi> Dublin, <hi>that</hi> Orange <hi>is certainly dead, ſo that all will be well again.</hi> Such were their Hopes and Expectations at that time: But though they believed moſt of thoſe things, yet they did not certainly know what to make on't, for they had no good opinion of the late King, as may appear by a great many inſtances; for <hi>Sarcefield</hi> ſometime afterward, ſpeak<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of the Action at the <hi>Boyn,</hi> ſwore <hi>if we would change Kings they would fight it over again and beat us.</hi> For, certainly, the Courage and Countenance of the Chief Commander in Armies is a material Point in the ſucceſs of the Action, and eſpecially in Kings; for he that has a Genius to the War has Advantages above other Men; that makes his Gentry, Nobility, and Officers ſtrive to imitate his Example, by which he is better ſerved, and com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monly more fortunate.</p>
            <p>The 15th. we remained Encamped at <hi>Mullingar,</hi> and about 500 <hi>Creights</hi> came from the County of <hi>Longford,</hi> with their Wives, Children, Cattle, and every thing that they could bring away; their buſineſs was to procure the Generals Protection, which was granted them, and they moved homewards as the Army marched forwards, but were moſt of them plundered af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terwards. There had been a <hi>Friery</hi> at <hi>Mullingar</hi> during the late Kings Reign, but the <hi>Friday</hi> before we got thither the Fathers thought fit to go a Pilgrimage into <hi>Conaught.</hi> This Evening a party of Col. <hi>Ruſſel</hi>'s Horſe went towards <hi>Athlone,</hi> and came within three miles of the place, but did no feats worth the men<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tioning; next day we marcht to <hi>Ballimoor,</hi> where ſtands a ſtrong Houſe at the ſide of a Lough, which the Enemy has ſince forti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fied: <note place="margin" type="runSum">
                  <hi>Athlone</hi> Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſieged.</note> And <hi>Thurſday, July</hi> 17th. we came before <hi>Athlone,</hi> and
<pb n="101" facs="tcp:98441:57"/> encamped within a quarter of a mile of the Town; the Ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>my playing their great Guns upon us as we marched, but did us little dammage. The General ſent a Drum to Summons the Town; but old Colonel <hi>Grace,</hi> the Governor, fired a Piſtol at him, and ſent word thoſe were the Terms he was for. The Town it ſelf ſtands on a narrow Neck of Land between two Bogs, (one on either ſide the <hi>Shannon,</hi>) and you cannot come to it, much leſs paſs the River any where, up or down, within ſix or eight miles except at the Town, through the midſt of which the River <hi>Shannon</hi> runs, and is both very broad and deep, being by much the greateſt in theſe three Kingdoms. <hi>Ptolomy</hi> calls this River <hi>Senus; Giraldus Flumen, Senenſe;</hi> but the <hi>Iriſh</hi> call it <hi>Shannon,</hi> that is, the Ancient River. It ariſes out of <hi>Theru</hi> Hills in the County of <hi>Le<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trim,</hi> and running through an excellent Country, and ſeve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral Towns, (particularly <hi>Limerick</hi> and <hi>Athlone,</hi>) it falls into the Sea beyond <hi>Knock-Patrick,</hi> a Mountain upon which St. <hi>Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trick</hi> conjured all the Venomous Creatures in <hi>Ireland,</hi> and threw them into the Sea, inſomuch that nothing of that kind has appeared, or will live, in that Kingdom ever ſince, (if you'll believe what the <hi>Iriſh</hi> do;) however, this River is Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vigable for above twenty Leagues. That part of <hi>Athlone</hi> ſtand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing on the South-ſide the <hi>Shannon</hi> is called the <hi>Engliſh</hi> Town, and that on the other, the <hi>Iriſh</hi> Town, where ſtands a very ſtrong Caſtle. <hi>Athlone</hi> is the head Town in the County of <hi>Roſcommon,</hi> and was formerly the Barony of the <hi>O Kelly</hi>'s. There is a very good Stone-Bridge between the two Towns, which was Built by Sir <hi>Henry Sidney</hi> in Queen <hi>Elizabeth</hi>'s time, and becauſe this is commonly accounted the Center of <hi>Ireland,</hi> that Queen once deſigned to make it the Reſidence of the Lords Juſtices. The <hi>Engliſh</hi> Town not being ſo eaſie to defend, the <hi>Iriſh</hi> Burnt it the day before our coming, and broke down the Bridge. They had ſeveral very convenient opportunities to diſturb us in our march to the Town, becauſe of the Bogs, Woods, and Paſſes that lay very advantageous for that pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe, but they retired over the River, to defend the other ſide; about 200 Yards above the Town they had raiſed ſome Breaſt-works; on the River ſide, nigh the end of the Bridge, they had caſt up ſeveral Redoubts, and other Works, and had planted
<pb n="102" facs="tcp:98441:58"/> two Batteries of two Guns a piece, beſides what were in the Caſtle.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Friday</hi> we ſpent in contriving our Batteries, and our Works, and on <hi>Saturday</hi> we planted two Field-Pieces, which did the Enemies Guns ſome damage; then one hundred and fifty Men out of each Regiment were ordered to make and carry Faſcines; and in two days more we had a Battery of ſix Guns finiſhed, nigh the Bridge-end, which plaid upon the Caſtle, and made a ſmall Breach to wards the top. On <hi>Sunday</hi> the 20th. the General ſent a De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tachment of Horſe, commanded by Lieutenant-Colonel <hi>Barry,</hi> and 150 Granadeers mounted, commanded by Major <hi>Morgiſon</hi> and Captain <hi>Carlile,</hi> towards <hi>Lanesbrough</hi> Paſs, but they re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turned the next day, without doing any thing that was Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>markable; the Enemy having a Fort well mann'd towards the Bridge, and four Companies of Foot in the Town. That day one Captain <hi>Mackgill,</hi> a Voluntier, was kill'd at our Battery with a Canon-ſhot from the Caſtle. Our Train at <hi>Athlone</hi> was only two twelve Pounders, ten leſſer Guns, and two ſmall Field Mortars; which, when planted againſt the Caſtle, did it little or no damage: (This was a misfortune that Lieutenant-General <hi>Douglas</hi> found <hi>Athlone</hi> ſtronger than he expected, for it's ſaid, he had what Guns and Men he deſired to reduce it withal.) The firing continued, however, on both ſides; and on <hi>Tueſday</hi> one Mr. <hi>Nelſon,</hi> our beſt Gunner, was killed with a ſmall Shot. On <hi>Wedneſday</hi> we had news that <hi>Sarcefield,</hi> with 15000 Men, was coming to raiſe the Siege; which made the General ſend all his ſick and wounded Men towards <hi>Mullin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gar.</hi> Next Morning early, the Beſieged hung out a Bloody Flag, which occaſion'd ſmart firing; and in the Evening the General called all the Colonels to a Council of War, where he told them the neceſſity of Removing from the Town; for we had very little Bread all the while, and there was ſome reaſon to believe the <hi>Iriſh</hi> Army would cut off our Commu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nication from <hi>Dublin.</hi> So that we had Orders to be ready to march at twelve a Clock that Night; we begun at the time appointed to ſend away our Baggage, and at break of Day, or a little after, we marcht off, the Enemy not ſo much as firing one Gun at us.</p>
            <pb n="103" facs="tcp:98441:58"/>
            <p>
               <note place="margin" type="runSum">Reaſons why it was not taken.</note> I know that whilſt we lay here there were ſome that prof<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferr'd to paſs the River at a Ford a little above the Bridge, and ſo beat the <hi>Iriſh</hi> out of their Works; but this was ſooner ſaid than done, for the Ford is naturally very deep and dan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gerous; beſides, the <hi>Iriſh</hi> had fortified the other ſide with Breaſt-works, two Batteries, and a conſiderable Fort: And then if we had forced our way over, and could not have taken the Caſtle in a ſmall time, we muſt have been obliged to fight the greateſt part of the <hi>Iriſh</hi> Army, which was then drawing down upon us. Nay, if we had been Maſters of the Town and Caſtle, the <hi>Iriſh</hi> might ſo have ordered it, as to have cut off our Communication from <hi>Dublin,</hi> and ſo ſtarved us, for we were already glad of a very ſmall Allowance of Bread.</p>
            <p>Colonel <hi>Grace,</hi> the Governor, had been very active on the <hi>Iriſh</hi> ſide in the laſt Wars, but was now very old, and this was the third time that he had burnt that Town; the Enemy had in it three Regiments of Foot, nine Troops of Dragoons, and two of Horſe, and more lay encamped not far off. During our ſtay here (which was from <hi>Thurſday</hi> the 17th. to <hi>Friday</hi> the 25th.) the Country People, of all Perſwaſions, begun to think us troubleſome.</p>
            <p>This muſt be ſaid for Lieutenant-General <hi>Douglas,</hi> that both whilſt he ſtaid here, and all along on his march, he conſtantly gave out very ſtrict Orders againſt Plundering or Stragling from the Army. But it were better that good Rules were not made, than when they are ſo, they ſhould not be obſerved, and the breakers eſcape puniſhment. For ſome Peoples taking li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>berty to break Rules, encourage others to loſe their Reverence to them. Example always goes further than Precept, and moſt Men ſee better than they underſtand; ſo that whatever Rules are made in an Army by a General, they are to be obſerved by every one; elſe with what juſtice can one be puniſhed for the breach of thoſe Orders, which others make no Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcience in obeying.</p>
            <pb n="104" facs="tcp:98441:59"/>
            <p>
               <note place="margin" type="runSum">What Men loſt there.</note> We loſt in this Expedition not above thirty Men before the Town, and the Enemy very few; but in our march too and again, what with ſickneſs, hard marching, the Rapperees ſur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>priſing as they ſtraggled, and ſeveral other diſadvantages, we fell ſhort of our Number three or four hundred; though be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore we got to the Kings Army we killed and took Pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſoners a great many thouſands, but more of theſe had four Feet than two.</p>
            <p>All the poor Proteſtants thereabouts were now in a worſe condition than before, for they had enjoyed the benefit of the <hi>Iriſh</hi> Protections till our coming thither: and then ſhew<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing themſelves Friends to us, put them under a neceſſity of retreating with us; which a great many did, leaving all their Harveſt at that time ready to cut down, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> and yet were hardly uſed by our own Men.</p>
            <p>On our firſt Days march backwards, the General received an Expreſs from the King, (ſome ſay it was to draw off and joyn the Army, and that he had poſitive Orders before not to paſs the <hi>Shannon</hi> at all:) And at the ſame time we had an Account of a Conſpiracy in <hi>England</hi> againſt the Queen, and that ſome <hi>French</hi> were Landed there, having burnt ſome Towns on the Coaſt: And it was reported alſo that the late King was Landed in that Kingdom. We marched back that Day to <hi>Ballimore,</hi> where we ſtaid four Days; on one of which there hap'ned the greateſt Thunder and Lightning that has been heard of in thoſe parts. And about this time ſeveral of the <hi>Iriſh</hi> that had taken Protections, when they could not have the benefit of them, began to turn Rappe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rees, ſtripping and ſometimes killing our Men that they found ſtraggling.</p>

<pb n="113" facs="tcp:98441:63"/> becauſe of a great many thick Incloſures and Lanes; in one of which the Enemy appeared again. Our Men halted a little till the Pioneers had cut <gap reason="illegible" resp="#OXF" extent="1+ letters">

               </gap>wn the Hedges to the right and left; which done, they advanced, and the Enemy drew back. This took ſome time a doing, and therefore the Front of our Army, both of Horſe and Foot came up: The King was here at firſt, riding from one place to another to order Matters, as his Cuſtom always was. We cut the Hedges in a great many places, and went forwards, and the Enemy they drew home<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards, till they came to a narrow Paſs between two Bogs, within half a Mile of the Town. The Neck of Land be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween theſe Bogs is not above 150 Yards over, and this full of Hedges, with a large Orchard, a Stone Wall, and al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſo the Ruines of a great Houſe upon the Lane-ſide, which the <hi>Iriſh</hi> had burnt the Day before. But there were Three Lanes that led this way towards the Town, the middlemoſt being the broadeſt, the <hi>Iriſh</hi> Horſe ſtood in it, on the Paſs beyond this old Houſe; and whilſt our Pioneers were at work, the Front of our Horſe went up ſo cloſe, that there were ſeveral little Fi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rings, but not much damage done on either ſide: To the Right and Left of the <hi>Iriſh</hi> Horſe, the Hedges were all lined with Muſqueteers, of whom our Foot were got now within leſs than two hundred Yards. The Pioneers laboured at the Hedges all this while, and the Army made their Approaches in excellent Order: The Detached Party of Foot was upon the Advance towards the Centre, the Horſe a little to the Right of them, followed by the Earl of <hi>Drogheda</hi>'s Regiment, and Lieutenant General <hi>Douglas</hi> at the Head of them (my Lord <hi>Drogheda</hi> him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf being upon the Advance Guard). The <hi>Danes</hi> were to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards the Left, led on by the Prince of <hi>Wirtemberg,</hi> and Major General <hi>Kirk:</hi> The Blue <hi>Dutch,</hi> and ſeveral <hi>Engliſh</hi> Regiments, were upon the Right: All thoſe were lined with Horſe, and theſe ſupported again with more Foot: So that all Men that under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtood it, ſaid it was a moſt curious ſight; for though the Hedges were very thick and troubleſome, yet it was ſo ordered, that the Front kept all on a Line, except the advance Party, who went always ſome diſtance before. Whilſt things were going on thus, the King ordered Two Field-Pieces to be plant<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed towards the Left, where they could bear upon the Enemies Horſe. Theſe fired ſeveral times, and the Enemy ſoon quitted
<pb n="114" facs="tcp:98441:64"/> that Poſt. Our <hi>Engliſh</hi> Foot were ſo little concern'd, that though they knew the Enemy to be in the next Hedges, yet whilſt the Pioneers were at work, they would ſit them down, and ask one another, whether they thought they ſhould have any Bread to day? (for they began to want their Breakfaſts, though ſome few of them went to the next World for it.) The <hi>Danes</hi> to the Left ſtood with all the Care and Circumſpection in the World; but obſerving the Poſture of ſome of our Men, and hearing what they ſaid, they believed we had no mind to fight; yet no ſooner were the Hedges down, and our Front advancing in a narrow Field, but the <hi>Iriſh</hi> fired a whole Vol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ley upon them from the Neighbouring Hedges; which our Men ſeeing, ſome of them cry'd aloud, <hi>Ah ye Toads, are ye there? we'll be with you preſently:</hi> And being led on by my Lord <hi>Drogheda</hi> and Colonel <hi>Earle,</hi> they ran along the Field directly towards the Hedges where the <hi>Iriſh</hi> were planted; which the others ſeeing, immediately quitted, and then our Men fired upon them as they retreated to the next Hedges, and ſo beat them from one Hedge to another, even to the very end of the Suburbs, which then were all burnt and levelled. During this Action the <hi>Danes</hi> advanced in the Left, and the Blue <hi>Dutch</hi> with the <hi>Engliſh</hi> on the Right, the Horſe coming on in the Centre. So that in leſs than half an hour from the firſt Vol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ley, the <hi>Iriſh</hi> were driven under their very Walls; nor did we loſe a Dozen Men in all this Action: When as if the <hi>Iriſh</hi> had managed this Advantage of Ground, and fortified the Paſs, as well as <hi>Ireton</hi>'s Fort on the Right of it, (which was built by <hi>Ireton</hi> on his firſt coming before <hi>Limerick:</hi> It ſtands on a Riſing Ground, and over-looks the Paſs on one ſide, and the Town on the other: (This we commonly called <hi>Cromwel</hi>'s <hi>Fort</hi>) they might have kept us ſome Days from approaching the Town; at leaſt, they might have kill'd us a great many Men: But the truth is, they had not time for all this: They had drawn up, however, ſeveral Companies of Men in the Fort, but when they ſaw us coming on, they retreated towards the Town with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out ever firing a Shot.</p>

The <hi>Danes</hi> encampt to the Left, where they found an Old Fort built by their Anceſtors, which they were very proud of; and from thence they fired Three or Four Field-Pieces up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on the <hi>Iriſh</hi> that lay entrenched between them and the Town.

            <p>Whether it was that His Majeſty was made believe the Town would ſurrender upon Summons, or what elſe was in it I know not; but when we ſate down before <hi>Limerick,</hi> we had only a Field-Train, though we had been a Month in our March from <hi>Dublin</hi> thither; and whether it be uſual to go be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore a Town without ſufficient Materials to force it, I am no Competent Judge: However, there were Six Twenty Four Pounders, Two Eighteen Pounders, a great quantity of Am<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>munition, much Proviſions, our Tin Boats, and abundance of other things all at this time upon the Road from <hi>Dublin,</hi> under the Care of Two Troops of Colonel <hi>Viller</hi>'s Horſe.</p>

<pb n="119" facs="tcp:98441:66"/> we were obliged to remove our Train beyond an Hill further off.

            <p>
               <hi>Monday</hi> the 11<hi>th.</hi> in the Morning, we planted ſix Twelve Pounders at <hi>Cromwell</hi>'s Fort, which diſmounted one of the Enemies beſt Guns upon the Spur, and did further damage to the Houſes in the Town. The ſame Morning came one <hi>Manus O Brian,</hi> a ſubſtantial Country Gentleman to the Camp, and gave notice that <hi>Sarsfield</hi> in the Night had paſs'd the River with a Body of Horſe, and deſign'd ſomething extraordinary: <note place="margin" type="runSum">
                  <hi>Sarsfield</hi> paſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes the River.</note> For when <hi>Sarsfield</hi> heard what the <hi>Frenchman</hi> had told, he was pretty ſure, that if thoſe Guns, Boats, and other Materials came up to us, the Town would not be able to hold out; and therefore he reſolves to run a hazard, and deſtroy them in their March if it were poſſible; if he ſucceeded, then he broke our Meaſures, but if not, he then deſign'd for <hi>France,</hi> if he did but ſurvive the Attempt: In order to which, he takes all the beſt Horſe and Dragoons that were in Town, and that very Night marches over the <hi>Shannon,</hi> at a Place called <hi>Killalow,</hi> a Biſhops See on the <hi>Shannon,</hi> Twelve Miles above our Camp. The Meſſenger that brought the News was not much taken notice of at firſt, moſt People looking upon it as a Dream; A great Officer however called him aſide, and after ſome indiffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rent Queſtions, askt him about a Prey of Cattel in ſuch a Place; which the Gentleman complain'd of afterwards, ſaying, he was ſorry to ſee General Officers mind Cattel more than the King's Honour. But after he met with ſome Acquaintance, he was brought to the King, who to prevent the worſt, gave Orders that a Party of Five hundred Horſe ſhould be made ready, and march to meet the Guns; but whether His Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jeſties Orders were not delivered to the Officer in Chief that was to Command the Party, or where the fault lay, I am no competent Judge, but it was certainly One or Two of the Clock in the Morning before the Party marched, which they did then very ſoftly, till about an hour after they ſaw a great Light in the Air, and heard a ſtrange rumbling Noiſe, which ſome conjectur'd to be the Train blown up, as it really
<pb n="120" facs="tcp:98441:67"/> was. For on <hi>Sunday</hi> night our Guns lay at <hi>Caſhell,</hi> and on <hi>Munday</hi> they marched beyond <hi>Cullen,</hi> to a little old Ruinous Caſtle, called <hi>Ballenedy,</hi> not Seven Miles from our Camp, and directly in the Rear of it, where they Encamped on a ſmall Piece of plain green Ground, there being ſeveral Earthen Fences on one ſide, and the old Caſtle on the other: If they had feared the leaſt danger, it had been eaſie to draw the Guns and every thing elſe within the Ruins of that old Caſtle, and then it had been difficult for an Army, much more a Party, to have touch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed them; Nay, it was eaſie to place them and the Carriages in ſuch a Figure upon the very Spot where they ſtood, that it had been certain Death to have come nigh them; but thinking themſelves at home, ſo nigh the Camp, and not fearing an E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nemy in ſuch a Place, eſpecially ſince they had no notice ſent them of it; they turn'd moſt of their Horſes out to Graſs, as being wearied with marching before, and the Guard they left was but a very ſlender one, the reſt moſt of them going to ſleep; but ſome of them awoke in the next World; <note place="margin" type="runSum">The Guns ſur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>priſed.</note> for <hi>Sarsfield</hi> all that day lurked amongſt the Mountains, and having notice where, and how our Men lay, he had thoſe that guided him through By-ways, to the very Spot, where he fell in amongſt them before they were aware, and cut ſeveral of them to Pieces, with a great many of the Waggoners, and ſome Country People that were coming to the Camp with Proviſions. The Officer Commanding in Chief, when he ſaw how it was, Command<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed to ſound to Horſe, but thoſe that endeavoured to fetch them up, were killed as they went out, or elſe ſaw it was too late to return: The Officers and others made what reſiſtance they could, but were at laſt obliged every Man to ſhift for him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf, which many of them did, though they loſt all their Hor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes, and ſome of them Goods of a conſiderable value: there was one Lieutenant <hi>Bell,</hi> and ſome few more of the Troopers killed, with Waggoners and Country People, to the Number in all of about Sixty: Then the <hi>Iriſh</hi> got up what Horſes they could meet withal, belonging either to the Troops or Train; ſome broke the Boats, and others drew all the Carriages and Wag<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gons, with the Bread, Ammunition, and as many of the Guns as they could get in ſo ſhort a time into one heap; the Guns they filled with Powder, and put their Mouths in the Ground that they might certainly ſplit; what they could pick up in a
<pb n="121" facs="tcp:98441:67"/> hurry they took away, and then laying a Train to the reſt, which being fired at their going off, blew all up with an Aſto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſhing noiſe; the Guns that were filled with Powder flying up from the Carriages into the Air, and yet two of them received on damage, though two more were ſplit and made unſervice<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able: every thing likewiſe that would burn, was reduced to Aſhes, before any could prevent it. The <hi>Iriſh</hi> took no Priſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ners, only a Lieutenant of Colonel <hi>Earl</hi>'s being ſick in a Houſe hard by, was ſtript and brought to <hi>Sarsfield,</hi> who us'd him ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry civilly, telling him, if he had not ſucceeded in that Enter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>priſe, he had then gone to <hi>France.</hi> Our Party of Horſe that was ſent from the Camp, came after the buſineſs was over, in ſight of the Enemies Rear; but wheeling towards the Left, to endeavour to intercept their Paſſage over the <hi>Shanon,</hi> they un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>happily went another way; ſince if our Party had been For<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tunate, they had a fair Opportunity firſt to ſave the Guns, and then to Revenge their loſs, and if either had been done, the Town had ſurrendred without much more Battering. Sir <hi>Albert Cunningham</hi>'s Dragoons were abroad alſo, who met with ſome of the <hi>Iriſh,</hi> kill'd a Major, one Captain <hi>James Fitz-Ger<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rald,</hi> and about Fifteen more, but the Main Body marched off ſecure.

            <p>This News was very unwelcome to every body in the Camp, the very private Men ſhewing a greater concern at the loſs, then one could expect from ſuch kind of People; the loſs of the Guns was not ſo great, as that of the Horſes and Ammunition; but to make the beſt of a bad Market, the Duke of <hi>Wyrtemberg,</hi> and ſeveral Great Officers, ſent their own Horſes, and every Foot Regiment furniſhed ſo many Garrons, to bring up the Guns and broken Carriages; as alſo to bring up two great Guns and a Mortar that were coming from <hi>Waterford.</hi>

After this his Majeſty ordered the Tren<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ches to be relieved in the day; and our Men marched always in and out, in the very Face of their Cannon.</p>

               <hi>Tueſday</hi> the 19th. our Battery plaid upon the Walls, and alſo the Guns from <hi>Cromwell</hi>'s Fort upon the Houſes in Town: And the Enemy were not idle; for their Shot flew very thick, <note place="margin" type="runSum">His Majeſty had a narrow eſcape.</note> inſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>much that the King riding ſoftly up towards <hi>Cromwell</hi>'s Fort, directly as His Horſe was entring a Gap, a Gentleman ſtaid His Majeſty to ſpeak to him, and in the very moment there ſtruck a Twenty four pounder in the very place, which would have ſtruck His Majeſty, and Horſe too, all to pieces, if His uſual good Angel had not defended Him; it ſtruck the Duſt all about Him however, tho' He took little notice of it, but alighting, came and laid Him down on the Fort, amongſt all the Duſt.

               <hi>Wedneſday</hi> the 20th. Colonel <hi>Cuts</hi>'s Granadeers, commanded by Captain <hi>Foxon,</hi> and my Lord <hi>Meath</hi>'s, by Captain <hi>Needham,</hi> were placed conveniently in the Trenches for an Attack; and at Two a Clock in the Afternoon (the Signal being given by firing Three Pieces of Cannon) they leapt over the Trenches,
<pb n="125" facs="tcp:98441:69"/> and ran ſtraight to the Fort which the Enemy had to the Right of us, at St. <hi>John</hi>'s Gate. The Enemy fired from the Fort, and from the Walls; our Men did the like from the Trenches; and the Great Guns went to work on both Sides. The Grana<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deers threw in their Granades, and Captain <hi>Foxon</hi> made an At<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tempt to climb up, but was thrown down again; but entred at the ſecond Trial, and his Men with him: So did my Lord <hi>Meath</hi>'s Men, with Captain <hi>Needham;</hi> and in a ſmall time we were Maſters of the Fort. There were about Fifty kill'd in it, and Twelve with the Captain taken Priſoners, and ſome made their Eſcapes to the Town. The Firing continued however on both Sides for above an Hour, and all poſſible diligence was uſed to bring down Faggots, wherewith to make up that ſide of the Fort that was open to the Town. Before the Attack, a Party of our Horſe were drawn up in a Lane, to the Right of the Trenches, to prevent the Enemy from ſallying, upon which the Enemies Cannon plaid; ſo that after the Fort was ours, they drew back beyond an Hill for their Security. <note place="margin" type="runSum">They ſally.</note> About an Hour after, ſome Friend in Town gave notice that the Enemy were going to ſally, which they did immediately, both Horſe and Foot, from St. <hi>John</hi>'s Gate: Their Horſe came up very nigh the Fort, tho' our Men fired from thence, and the Trenches, as faſt as they cou'd: Then the ſmall and great Shot on both ſides be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gan afreſh again. Major <hi>Wood</hi> of Colonel <hi>Byerley</hi>'s Regiment commanded an Advance Party of Twenty four <hi>French</hi> and Twenty ſeven <hi>Engliſh</hi> Horſe: At the Noiſe he advanced with this Party, and leaping a Ditch, he engaged immediately a Squadron of the <hi>Iriſh</hi> Horſe, and broke them. Then came in Lieutenant Colonel <hi>Windham,</hi> and Captain <hi>Lucy,</hi> as alſo ſome <hi>Dutch</hi> and <hi>Daniſh</hi> Horſe: Theſe charged the <hi>Iriſh</hi> that ſallied, and beat them back, following them almoſt to the very Gate. But we being expoſed to all the Enemies Shot from the Walls, loſt ſeveral in coming off; amongſt the reſt, Captain <hi>Lucy,</hi> a Gentleman much lamented by all that knew him. The King ſaw all this Action, (as indeed he did moſt things that hapned, going often into the Trenches, and never without danger) ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſſing Himſelf to be in pain for Major <hi>Wood,</hi> when he ſaw him and his Party in ſuch danger, loſing the greateſt part of them.

That Afternoon Captain <hi>Bourn</hi> was kill'd, as he was marching down to relieve the Trenches; and Major <hi>Mor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>giſon</hi> was wounded with a Cannon-bullet as he lay in Bed, of which he died in two days.</p>

               <note place="margin" type="runSum">A new Batte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry.</note> The 22d. we raiſed a Battery of Eight Guns, moſt Twenty four pounders, nigh the Fort that we took the day before, from whence we beat down Two Towers that ſtood upon the Wall, out of which the Enemy fired upon our Trenches. That night we threw good ſtore of Bombs and Carcaſſes into Town, which diſturb'd the Enemy very much, moſt of them having never ſeen ſuch things before.</p>
            <p>The 23d. there was a Drum ſent, and a Truce towards the Evening, for the Burying the Dead kill'd on both ſides at the taking the Fort.

I cannot omit a pleaſant Adventure that fell out at the taking the Fort, between a Chaplain in the Army and a Trooper. This Chaplain hapned to go down after the Fort was taken, and ſeeing a Trooper mortally wounded, in all appearance, he fancy'd himſelf obliged to give him his beſt Ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vice: The other was very thankful for it; and whilſt they were about the matter, comes the Sally. Our Horſe came thundring down, at which the Clergyman making haſte to get out of their way, he ſtumbled and fell down.

            <p>This Afternoon were Eighty four Priſoners brought to the Camp, from a Caſtle ſome twelve or fourteen Miles off, called <hi>Nignagh Round:</hi> Theſe kept out the Caſtle for Twenty four hours againſt Major General <hi>Ginkell</hi> and his Party of about 1500 Horſe and Dragoons; they kill'd us Fourteen Men; <note place="margin" type="runSum">

In the Evening our Bombs and red-hot Balls began to fly, which ſet part of the Town on fire, which burnt all that night, deſtroying a great quantity of Hay, with ſeveral Houſes. I remember we were all as well pleaſed to ſee the Town flaming as could be, which made me reflect upon our Profeſſion of Soldiery, not to be overcharg'd with Good-nature.</p>

               <note place="margin" type="runSum">Another Bat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tery.</note> The 24th. we fired pretty ſmartly, but our Guns only ſtruck the top of the Wall off, and therefore we raiſed a new Battery within ſixty Yards of the Wall, and that Night drew the Angle of our Trenches within twenty Yards of the Counterſcarp; Thirty Voluntiers out of a Regiment working very diligently, and had Two ſhillings apiece for their pains; ſeveral Wooll-ſacks being carried down to ſecure our Men from Shot as they were at work. <hi>Monday</hi> morning we began to fire from our new Battery, and the Breach in the Wall began to be conſidera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble; which the Enemy ſeeing, brought abundance of Wool<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſacks, to damp the force of our Cannon. This was like <hi>Joſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phus</hi>'s defending his Towns in <hi>Gallilee,</hi> who filled large Sacks full of Chaff, and hung them over the Walls, to defend them from the Battering Rams of the <hi>Romans;</hi> for Cannons were not then invented.</p>

               <note place="margin" type="runSum">The Breach appears.</note> The King ſent his Gunners ſome Drink down to the Batte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries, which made them ply their Work very heartily; and for all the Wool-ſacks, the Wall began to fly again; and early that Morning were two Cannon planted about 300 Yards to the right of our Trenches, in order to beat down the Bridge: But we were too late a beginning this Work; the <hi>Iriſh</hi> ſeeing what we intended, were very much afraid of the Bridge, and and therefore they planted two Guns without the Town, in the <hi>King's Iſland,</hi> which plaid upon our Battery, and alſo flankt their own Counterſcarp. You muſt know, that two or three
<pb n="128" facs="tcp:98441:71"/> days before this, it had rain'd ſo violently for nigh twenty four hours together, that the Soldiers were almoſt up to the Knees in the Trenches.

That Night therefore a Council of War was held, whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther we ſhou'd make an Attack upon the Counterſcarp next day; and it was deferred till <hi>Wedneſday,</hi> becauſe as yet the Breach was not wide enough: Monſieur <hi>Cambon</hi> was for defer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring it for two or three days longer, which had been a great happineſs if it had; and yet this could not well be, for our Am<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>munition began to ſink.</p>

               <hi>Wedneſday</hi> the 27th. a Breach being made nigh St. <hi>John</hi>'s Gate, over the <hi>Black Battery,</hi> that was about Twelve Yards in length, and pretty flat, as it appear'd to us, the King gave Orders that the Counterſcarp ſhould be attack'd that Afternoon; to which purpoſe a great many Wool-ſacks were carry'd down, and good ſtore of Ammunition, with other things ſuitable for ſuch a Work. All the Granadeers in the Army were ordered to march down into the Trenches, which they did. Thoſe being above Five hundred, were commanded each Company by their reſpective Captains, and were to make the firſt Attack, being ſupported by one Battalion of the Blue <hi>Dutch</hi> on the Right, then Lieutenant General <hi>Douglas</hi>'s Regiment, Brigadeer <hi>Stu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>art</hi>'s, my Lord <hi>Meath</hi>'s, and my Lord <hi>Lisburn</hi>'s, as alſo a <hi>Bran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>denburgh</hi> Regiment. Theſe were all poſted towards the Breach; upon the left of whom were Colonel <hi>Cutts</hi> and the <hi>Danes.</hi> Lieu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tenant General <hi>Douglas</hi> commanded, and their Orders were to poſſeſs themſelves of the Counterſcarp, and maintain it. We had alſo a Body of Horſe drawn up, to ſuccour the Foot upon occaſion. About half an hour after Three, the Signal being given by firing three Pieces of Cannon, the Granadeers being in the furtheſt Angle of our Trenches, leapt over, and run to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards the Counterſcarp, firing their Pieces, and throwing their Granades. This gave the Alarm to the <hi>Iriſh,</hi> who had their Guns all ready, and diſcharged great and ſmall Shot upon us as faſt as 'twas poſſible: Our Men were not behind them in ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther;
<pb n="129" facs="tcp:98441:71"/> ſo that in leſs than two Minutes the Noiſe was ſo terri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble, that one would have thought the very Skies ready to rent in ſunder. This was ſeconded with Duſt, Smoke, and all the Terrors that the Art of Man could invent, to ruine and undo one another; and to make it the more uneaſie, the Day it ſelf was exceſſive hot to the By-ſtanders, and much more ſure in all reſpects to thoſe upon action. Captain <hi>Carlile,</hi> of my Lord <hi>Drogheda</hi>'s Regiment, run on with his Granadeers to the Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terſcarp, and tho' he received two Wounds between that and the Trenches, yet he went forwards, and commanded his Men to throw in their Granades; but in the leaping into the dry Ditch below the Counterſcarp, an <hi>Iriſhman</hi> below ſhot him dead. Lieutenant <hi>Barton</hi> however encouraged the Men, and they got upon the Counterſcarp, and all the reſt of the Granadeers were as ready as they. By this time the <hi>Iriſh</hi> were throwing down their Arms, and running as faſt as they could into Town; which our Men perceiving, entred the Breach pell<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mell with them, and above half the Earl of <hi>Drogheda</hi>'s Grana<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deers, and ſome others, were actually in Town. The Regi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments that were to ſecond the Granadeers went to the Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terſcarp, and having no Orders to go any further, there ſtopt. The <hi>Iriſh</hi> were all running from the Walls, and quite over the Bridge, into the <hi>Engliſh</hi> Town, but ſeeing but a few of our Men enter, they were with much ado perſuaded to rally; and thoſe that were in, ſeeing themſelves not followed, and their Ammunition being ſpent, they deſigned to retreat; but ſome were ſhot, ſome taken, and the reſt came out again, but very few without being wounded. The <hi>Iriſh</hi> then ventured upon the Breach again, and from the Walls and every place ſo pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſter'd us upon the Counterſcarp, that after nigh three hours re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiſting Bullets, Stones, (broken Bottles, from the very Women, who boldly ſtood in the Breach, and were nearer our Men than their own) and whatever ways could be thought on to deſtroy us, our Ammunition being ſpent, it was judged ſafeſt to return to our Trenches. When the Work was at the hotteſt, the <hi>Brandenburgh</hi> Regiment (who behaved themſelves very well) were got upon the <hi>Black Battery,</hi> where the Enemies Powder hapned to take fire, and blew up a great many of them, the Men, Faggots, Stones, and what not, flying into the Air with a moſt terrible noiſe. Colonel <hi>Cutts</hi> was commanded
<pb n="130" facs="tcp:98441:72"/> by the Duke of <hi>Wyrtemberg</hi> to march towards the Spur at the South Gate, and beat in the <hi>Iriſh</hi> that appeared there; which he did, tho' he loſt ſeveral of his Men, and was himſelf wounded: For he went within half Musket-ſhot of the Gate, and all his Men open to the Enemies Shot, who lay ſecure within the Spur and the Walls. The <hi>Danes</hi> were not idle all this while, but fired upon the Enemy with all imaginable fury, and had ſeveral kill'd; but the miſchief was, we had but one Breach, and all towards the Left it was impoſſible to get into the Town when the Gates were ſhut, if there had been no Enemy to oppoſe us, without a great many Scaling-ladders, which we had not. From half an hour after Three, till after Seven, there was one continued Fire of both great and ſmall Shot, without any intermiſſion; inſomuch that the Smoke that went from the Town reached in one continued Cloud to the top of a Mountain at leaſt ſix Miles off.</p>
            <p>When our Men drew off, ſome were brought up dead, and ſome without a Leg; others wanted Arms, and ſome were blind with Powder; eſpecially a great many of the poor <hi>Bran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>denburgers</hi> look'd like Furies, with the Misfortune of Gun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>powder. One Mr. <hi>Upton</hi> getting in amongſt the <hi>Iriſh</hi> in Town, and ſeeing no way to eſcape, went in the Crowd un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diſcovered, till he came at the Governour, and then ſurrendred himſelf. There was a Captain, one <hi>Bedloe,</hi> who deſerted the Enemy the day before, and now went upon the Breach, and fought bravely on our ſide; for which His Majeſty gave him a Company.</p>
            <p>The King ſtood nigh <hi>Cromwell</hi>'s Fort all the time, and the Buſineſs being over, He went to His Camp very much con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cern'd, as indeed was the whole Army; for you might have ſeen a mixture of Anger and Sorrow in every bodies Counte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nance. The <hi>Iriſh</hi> had two ſmall Field pieces planted in the <hi>King's Iſland,</hi> which flankt their own Counterſcarp, and in our Attack did us no ſmall damage, as did alſo two Guns more that they had planted within the Town, oppoſite to the Breach, and charged with Cartridge-ſhot.</p>
            <p>
               <note place="margin" type="runSum">The Loſs at this Attack.</note> We loſt at leaſt Five hundred upon the Spot, and had a thouſand more wounded, as I underſtood by the Surgeons of our Hoſpitals, who are the propereſt Judges.

            <p>Theſe make in all Fifty nine, whereof Fifteen were killed upon the Spot, and ſeveral dyed afterwards of their Wounds; the Granadeers are not here included, and they had the hotteſt Service: Nor are there any of the Forreigners, who loſt full as many as the <hi>Engliſh;</hi> ſo that I'm afraid this did more then countervail the loſs that the <hi>Iriſh</hi> had during the whole Seige, at leaſt in the numher of Men.</p>
            <p>Next day the King ſent a Drummer, in order to a Truce, that the Dead might be buried, but the <hi>Iriſh</hi> had no mind to it; and now the Soldiers were in hopes that the King would make a ſecond Attack, and ſeem'd reſolv'd to have the Town or dye every Man. But this was too great a hazard to run at one Place, and they did not know how ſcarce our Ammunition was, it being very much waſted the day before; this day however we continued Battering the Wall, and it begun to Rain; and next day it was very Cloudy all about, and Rain'd very faſt; ſo that every Body began to dread the Conſequences of it. The King therefore calls a Council of War, wherein it was Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolv'd to quit the Town and Raiſe the Siege, which as the Caſe ſtood then with us, was no doubt the moſt prudent thing that could be done. <note place="margin" type="runSum">The Siege Rai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed.</note> We drew off therefore our heavy Cannon from the Batteries by degrees: And on <hi>Saturday Auguſt</hi> the 30. we marched greateſt part of them as far as <hi>Cariganliſs,</hi> the Guard being the Earl of <hi>Drogheda</hi>'s and Brigedeer <hi>Stuart</hi>'s Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>giments. The Rain which had already fallen had ſoftned the ways, and we found ſome difficulty in getting off our Guns, eſpecially ſince for the moſt part we were obliged to draw them with Oxen, a part of our Train Horſes being diſpoſed of to the Enemies uſe before; and this was one main Reaſon for
<pb n="133" facs="tcp:98441:73"/> Raiſing the Siege; for if we had not (granting the Weather to continue bad) we muſt either have taken the Town, or of ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſity have loſt our Cannon, becauſe that part of the Country lies very low, and the Ways are deep. Therefore on <hi>Sun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>day</hi> the laſt of <hi>Auguſt,</hi> all the Army drew off, (having a good Body of Horſe in the Rear): As ſoon as the <hi>Iriſh</hi> perceived we had quitted our Trenches, they took Poſſeſſion of them with great Joy, and were in a ſmall time after over all the Ground whereon we had Encamped; two days before we Raiſed the Siege, a great many Waggons and Carriages were ſent to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards <hi>Caſhell</hi> and <hi>Clonmel,</hi> with ſick and wounded Men, which was the Reaſon that we were forced to leave a great many Bombs, Hand Granades, and other things behind which we buried in the Artillery Ground, but with a Train to blow them up; ſo that when it took Fire the <hi>Iriſh</hi> were mightily afraid, and thought we were beginning a new Seige from under Ground: But yet they dug up moſt of our dead Officers and Soldiers, only to get their Shirts and Shrowds.</p>

            <p>Some that are Men already prejudiced, will pretend to be Judges in this Affair (though they never ſaw the Place or the Country) and affirm, that the <hi>Iriſh</hi> made never a falſe ſtep, but one, during this whole Siege, and that was, in not Fortifying the Paſs, and <hi>Cromwell</hi>'s Fort without; as alſo in not drawing a large Trench from the River towards the <hi>Eaſt,</hi> and then runing it round that part of the Town, on which they might have raiſed ſeveral Forts and Breaſt-works; from whence they might have retarded our Approaches; but indeed they had not time for all this, though they had done ſomething of that kind to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards the <hi>West,</hi> where they keept Men Encampt all the while we lay before the Town; and they had made alſo ſome Forts towards the <hi>Eaſt,</hi> but they could not put Courage in their Men to defend them, eſpecially when Walls were ſo near to fly to.</p>

               </note> What Objections they make againſt us were theſe, that we ought to have divided our Army, and ſent a part beyond the River; as alſo to have broke down the two Bridges, one be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween the two Towns, and the other on the County of <hi>Clare</hi> ſide; by which means we had prevented the <hi>Iriſh</hi> Communication
<pb n="135" facs="tcp:98441:74"/> between the two Towns, and alſo from without; the great<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eſt hazard that we could run, being to Attack a Town that had one ſide open, to bring in what Men and things they pleas'd. All theſe, and a great many more inconveniencies were ſeen into at that Inſtant; but the dividing the Army was impracticable, becauſe that when one Part had been over the River, they muſt have marched ſeveral Miles to the Right, and then down again, before they could come nigh the other ſide of the Town, by reaſon of a vaſt Bog that runs from the Town a great way croſs the Country, and then it was no eaſie thing to bring Proviſion to thoſe: and beſides, if the Rains had fallen (as it often threatned us) that part of the Army which had gone over, muſt have run the hazard either of ſtarving, or fighting their whole Army, or both; for the <hi>Sha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>non</hi> riſes all on a ſudden, and the leaſt ſwelling in the World, would have made it impaſſible for the Army, ſince it was with great difficulty that ſingle Regiments could get over as it was, and it never has been ſeen ſo low in many years. Nor had we Men enough, to make what Works were convenient, to ſecure both Parts of the Army from Sallies or Aſſaults from without, if we had been divided. We know <hi>Caeſar</hi> at the Siege of <hi>Alexia,</hi> ſhut in Eighty thouſand <hi>Guals;</hi> made a Line of Countervallation of Eleven Miles Circumfe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rence; and one of Circumvallation that was Fourteen, For<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tifying both theſe with Sharp Stakes, and vaſt Holes in the Ground, ſlightly covered over; by which, he both reduced that great Army within to his Mercy, and kept off a much greater, that deſign'd to Raiſe the Siege. But his Army were Men of Fatigue and Labour, as well as Courage, and his Numbers ſix times as great as ours. And though we were Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manded by a Prince of as great Courage and Reſolution as ever <hi>Caeſar</hi> was, and he had Men that were as willing, yet ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veral of them were beginning to be ſick, and were not able to endure the Fatigue; except both our Time had been longer, and the Seaſon better; and though Kings are Gods in Wiſdom as well as Power, yet there is one in Heaven that limits them.</p>

               </note> On the Firſt of <hi>October</hi> the Earl of <hi>Marlborough</hi> marched out of <hi>Cork</hi> to <hi>Five-mile Bridge,</hi> and the next day came near the Town, then in the poſſeſſion of our own Men: Towards the Evening the Lord <hi>Marlborough</hi> poſted his Men towards the New Fort; and Major General <hi>Tetteau,</hi> with 800 Men, the next morning early paſſed the River in Boats, &amp; ſtormed the <hi>Old Fort,</hi> in which he ſucceeded very well: Several Barrels of Powder at the ſame time accidentally taking fire, blew up nigh Forty of the Enemy; the reſt flying into an old Caſtle in the midſt of the Fort, were a great many of them kill'd before they got thither, and all that made reſiſtance, as we ſcaled the Walls were cut in pieces: <note place="margin" type="runSum">The Old Fort taken.</note> So that of 450 Men in this Fort, about 200 were blown up and kill'd, and the reſt ſubmitting to Mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy, were made Priſoners. Some endeavoured to eſcape to the New Fort by Water, but were moſt of them kill'd from the Shore. The Governor and ſeveral Officers that would have prevented our Men from coming over, were killed upon the Ramparts.</p>
            <p>
               <note place="margin" type="runSum">The New one beſieged.</note> My Lord <hi>Marlborough</hi> having gained this Fort, reſolves to make as quick work as he could with the New one; for the Weather was now very bad, and Proviſions were growing ſcarce; and withal, his Men began to fall ſick, which made him judge it was the beſt way to attack the Place briskly, in which he was like to loſe fewer Men, than if by lying long be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore it, he ſhould have it ſurrendred: He ſends a Summons however to the Governor to ſurrender, who return'd him an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwer, <hi>That it would be time enough to talk of that a Month hence.</hi> 
               <note place="margin" type="runSum">Batteries rai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed.</note> Whereupon the Cannon being planted, we began to batter the Fort in two Places, the <hi>Danes</hi> on the Left, and the <hi>Engliſh</hi> on the Right. On the Fifth of <hi>October</hi> the Trenches were opened, and on the Ninth we were got nigh the Counterſcarp. On the Twelfth in the Morning Six Pieces of Cannon were mounted at the <hi>Danes</hi> Attack, and Two Mortars at the <hi>Engliſh,</hi> which fired all day, and the Mortars continued all night. On the
<pb n="145" facs="tcp:98441:79"/> Thirteenth Two Guns of Twenty four pound Ball were planted on the <hi>Engliſh</hi> Battery, and on the Fourteenth Three more; for the <hi>Danes</hi> on their ſide had made a pretty large Breach. We then ſprung a Mine with very good ſucceſs, and were pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>paring to ſpring another; and being Maſters of the Counter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcarp, on the Fifteenth the Cannon plaid all the Morning, and every thing was ready to lay our Galleries over the Ditch: But at one a Clock the Enemy beat a Parly, and deſired a Treaty about the Surrendry of the Fort; <note place="margin" type="runSum">The Fort ſur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rendred.</note> which being done, the Articles were agreed to and ſigned, by which the middle Baſtion was to be delivered up next Morning, and the Garri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon (being about 1200 Men) to march out the day after, with their Arms and Baggage, and be conducted to <hi>Limerick.</hi> We had kill'd and wounded in our ſeveral Attacks about 200; but a great many more were ſick and dead by reaſon of bad Weather. In this Fort we received a very conſiderable Maga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zine, and great plenty of all ſorts of Proviſions, ſufficient to have ſupported a thouſand Men for a Year; there were 1000 Barrels of Wheat, 1000 Barrels of Beef, Forty Tuns of Clar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ret, a great quantity of Sack, Brandy, and ſtrong Beer. My Lord <hi>Marleborough</hi> did a conſiderable piece of Service in redu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cing thoſe Places, which will be of great advantage to the next Campagn.</p>
            <p>(In <hi>October,</hi> 1601. <hi>Don John d' Aquila</hi> landed at <hi>Kingſale</hi> from <hi>Spain,</hi> with an Army to aſſiſt the <hi>Iriſh</hi> againſt Queen <hi>Elizabeth,</hi> calling himſelf <hi>Maſter General and Captain of the Catholick King in the War of God, for holding and keeping the Faith in</hi> Ireland: But by the Courage and Induſtry of Sir <hi>Charles Blunt</hi> Baron <hi>Mountjoy,</hi> then Lord Deputy, the <hi>Iriſh</hi> were defeated, and the <hi>Spaniards</hi> forced to go home upon diſhonourable Terms.)</p>
            <p>But to return again to <hi>Dublin,</hi> and the Affairs of that part of the Kingdom. On the 18th of <hi>October</hi> the Blue <hi>Dutch</hi> Guards ſet ſail for <hi>England,</hi> and a day or two afterwards land<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed Colonel <hi>Mathews</hi>'s Dragoons and Count <hi>Schonberg</hi>'s Horſe from thence. And now after the taking of <hi>Cork</hi> and <hi>Kingſale,</hi> part of the <hi>Iriſh</hi> Army that was in <hi>Kerry</hi> made ſeveral Incurſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, and burnt all the Towns and Villages of the Counties of <hi>Cork,</hi> and <hi>Limerick,</hi> that had hitherto eſcap'd. My Lord Duke of <hi>Berwick</hi> dined in <hi>Charlevil-houſe,</hi> one of the Second-rate Houſes of theſe Kingdoms, built by the late Earl of <hi>Orrery,</hi>
               <pb n="146" facs="tcp:98441:80"/> and after Dinner order'd it to be fir'd, and ſtaid to ſee it in Aſhes. And thoſe of the <hi>Iriſh</hi> Army that lay between <hi>Limerick</hi> and <hi>Athlone,</hi> burnt <hi>Balliboy,</hi> wherein were Six Companies of my Lord <hi>Drogheda</hi>'s Regiment: The thing was thus. Lieut. Col. <hi>Briſtow</hi> was at the Breaking-up of the Camp at <hi>Birr</hi> or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dered to <hi>Kilkormack</hi> Caſtle, a conſiderable Paſs, and within Two Miles of <hi>Balliboy;</hi> but he liking <hi>Balliboy</hi> better, as a Place of more Forrage and Shelter for the Men, quitted the other, and took moſt of his Men into that open Village; which the <hi>Iriſh</hi> having notice of, came in the night, and lay in the Hedges nigh the Town. Our Men had heard of the deſigned Attempt the day before, and deſired Colonel <hi>Briſtow</hi> to deliver out Ammunition; but he apprehending no danger, took no care to prepare for ſuch a Miſchief: However, our Men ſate up all that night, and ſent out a Lieutenant, with Twenty Men mounted, to learn Tidings of the Enemy, who returned without diſcove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring any, for they were all this while cloſe in the Hedges. Af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter <hi>Revallia,</hi> the Officers and Soldiers, thinking all ſafe, went to their Lodgings, all but the ordinary Guard: They had not been diſperſed half an hour, till the <hi>Iriſh</hi> ſet both ends of the Town on fire. The Officers and Soldiers made what haſte they could to a Mount towards the middle of the Town, where they ſtaid till a Party of Dragoons came from <hi>Birr</hi> to their Relief; for the <hi>Iriſh</hi> after ſome ſmall time drew off, and would not adventure to force them from the Mount, tho' they were four times our number. We had about Twenty eight kill'd, and ſome wounded: And Captain <hi>Henry Gore,</hi> as he was going towards the Mount, had a Rencounter with ſome of the <hi>Iriſh</hi> Granadeers, in which with Club-Musket he had his Jaw-bone broke, and ſeveral Wounds on the Head; but he is ſince recover'd. We kill'd ſeveral of the Enemy, both in the Streets, and in the Houſes that they went to plunder.</p>
            <p>The 21th. ſome of the <hi>Rapparees</hi> march'd towards <hi>Philipſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>town</hi> in the <hi>King's County.</hi> A Party of ours going out to diſco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver them, took two of their Officers and hanged them. And the 23d. being the Anniverſary of the former <hi>Iriſh</hi> Rebellon, was kept with great Solemnity; a Proclamation being iſſued out the day before, commanding the Sixteenth of <hi>November</hi> to be kept as a day of Thankſgiving, for preſerving the King,
<pb n="147" facs="tcp:98441:80"/> and reducing three entire Provinces: Which accordingly was obey'd.</p>
            <p>On the 28th. there came an Account from <hi>Meerſcourt</hi> in the County of <hi>West-Meath,</hi> that part of the Enemies Forces ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vanced from <hi>Lanesborough</hi> in the County of <hi>Longford,</hi> and came within ſix Miles of <hi>Meerſcourt,</hi> but retreated without any harm done to either ſide. If I am not much miſtaken, when we left <hi>Limerick,</hi> it was our Buſineſs (and Advice was given according<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly) to ſecure all the Paſſes upon the <hi>Shanon;</hi> which had been eaſie at that time, our Army being together, and in the Field; for theſe, and the Caſtles all along by the <hi>Shanon</hi> ſide, might eaſily have been made tenable, where our Men might have been ſecure, and had a very plentiful Country at their Backs for their Relief; and then might have made Incurſions into <hi>Conaught</hi> when they pleaſed: But in ſtead of that, we re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tired further into the Country, and left them all the Paſſes and Forts upon the <hi>Shanon;</hi> by which means they are not to be kept in their own Province, as they might have been, but can both keep us out, and alſo come amongſt us when they have a mind to it.</p>

               </note> About this time the Enemy gave leave to ſeveral <hi>Proteſtants</hi> to come off, who gave account, that all things were very ſcarce amongſt them, Wheat being generally about Ten pound (Braſs Money) a Barrel; Malt, Nine pound; Brandy, Three pound a Quart; Ale, Two Shillings ſix pence; Mens Shooes, Thirty ſhillings; Salt, Twenty ſhillings a Quart: And that the <hi>Iriſh</hi> Army were in a very miſerable condition in all reſpects.

But then after all this, they have a vaſt Crowed of People, and will not, nor cannot have convenient Subſiſtence for one half of them in a ſmall time: And further, the <hi>French</hi> are retired, and it's to be ſuppoſed without deſign of returning; elſe they would not have gone away: Suppoſe therefore the <hi>Iriſh</hi> for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tifie all thoſe Places in their poſſeſſion, and have Arms and Ammunition, with whatever elſe is needful from <hi>France,</hi> yet all this will neither put Courage into them, to defend thoſe Places, nor is it altogether in the power of <hi>France</hi> to ſupply them with neceſſary Proviſions.</p>

            <p>
               <note place="margin" type="runSum">And laſtly, Of our own.</note> But, Secondly, As to our own Army, I doubt not but we have ſeveral that are indifferent whether the War be quickly at an end or not; for they find the <hi>Iriſh</hi> to be an eaſie ſort of Enemy, and if the War were done here, they muſt expect hotter Service ſomewhere elſe. They look upon it however as an Enemies Country, which is the reaſon that great Spoils are made, and Outrages committed; nay, which is worſt of all, no Diſtin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction made of <hi>Papiſt</hi> or <hi>Proteſtant.</hi> This, it's to be fear'd, may bring a Famine; and then all Peoples Condition in that King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom will be very ſevere: For tho' there be Plenty enough in <hi>England,</hi> yet the People of <hi>Ireland</hi> being poor, no body will be at the pains to carry their Goods into a Country where there is nothing to be got in return of them.</p>
            <p>But then whatſoever pains the <hi>Iriſh</hi> take in fortifying their Towns, we take as much in carrying things to beat them out of them; for there is a vaſt quantity of Bombs of the largeſt ſize, with all things convenient for ſuch a Deſign, daily brought to <hi>Dublin.</hi> And as to our Army, our Numbers are the ſame as laſt Year, (except Two Regiments that are broke:) they are alſo much healthfuller, and better acquainted both with the Country and their Arms; and to encourage us the more, the Parliament has granted His Majeſty a conſiderable Fund to carry on the War, as alſo to Equip His Fleet, which we were in both defective laſt Summer. Beſides, we have now at leaſt Twelve thouſand of the Militia in good order, either to defend our Garriſons behind us, or aſſiſt in our Army upon occaſion; for one ſhould think that there is no body ſo fit to fight for their own Country, or indeed to be entruſted with it, as thoſe People whoſe Concern it is. And more than all this, we ſhall have a great many <hi>Proteſtant Rapparees</hi> from the North and other Places, that we can at leaſt ſet againſt theirs; for the Northern People are moſt of them arm'd, either from our Men that died laſt Year, or by ſome means or other; ſo that I hope we ſhall have no want of Men.</p>
            <p>If therefore we have a mind to retrive our Loſſes, we muſt encourage ſuch as do well, and reward them for their Va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lour and Conduct; but puniſh Offenders, though their Sta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion be the greater. And as to the Arrears of the Army, they are not ſo very great as ſome People make them;
<pb n="162" facs="tcp:98441:88"/> for though we have not had our Accounts ſtated for ſome time, yet we have ſtill received Money upon Account, and the Soldiers have conſtantly been ſupplied with Bread and other Proviſions. But it's uſual with a great many, that when they can have no other Excuſe for their Extrava<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gancies, then they'll ſay, the King owes them ſo much; but ſay not a word of what they have received. And as to what the preſent <hi>Iriſh</hi> War both has coſt, and is like to do, both as to Men and Money; it is not to be named with that in <hi>Crom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>well</hi>'s time, which any may ſee, that will but read <hi>Burlace</hi>'s Hi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtory: Nor can there be any Compariſon between the preſent Government and that; for then both Law and Religion were trampled upon, but now they run in their due Channel.</p>
            <p>But after all, the Reaſon why <hi>Ireland</hi> was not reduc'd laſt Year, was our late taking the Field; and the Occaſion of that, was becauſe the Affairs of the Army could not be put in a compleat Poſture any ſooner: For <hi>England</hi> has a long time been uſed to Peace and Eaſe, and therefore unprovided of thoſe things that are abſolutely neceſſary in time of War, which were to come from abroad. The King did as much as was poſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſible in the time, as any who have ſeen the Country may know; for if <hi>Ireland</hi> were as well Peopled and Mann'd as the Soil it ſelf will bear, it may defie all the World beſides: You cannot ſee a Town or a ſmall Caſtle, but where there's either a Bog or a River, or both; all Places being fortified as well by Nature as Art: And in War there's no doubt but time muſt be allow'd to regulate ſuch Miſtakes as may happen, ſince no Man is infallible in that Art. Nor was there a ſufficient Fund of Money the Year paſt, to ſupply the real Neceſſities of ſo great a Work; which Inconveniency being now removed, a fair Concluſion may be rationally hoped for.</p>
            <p>As to the Charge of maintaining a competent Army there, when <hi>Ireland</hi> is reduced, the Country will night do that of it ſelf, ſince the Cuſtoms in that part of the Kingdom now in our poſſeſſion, amounted to Sixty ſeven thouſand five hundred twenty ſix pound for the Six Months laſt paſt; and what muſt the whole Kingdom come to in Times of Peace and a ſetled Eſtabliſhment? I have only this to add, That when our Armies go out to defie our Enemies, and yet at the ſame time
<pb n="163" facs="tcp:98441:88"/> in their Practice defie the Living God; or if we ſhould ſtay at home, and faſt and pray for their good Succeſs never ſo hear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tily; yet God will neither hear us, nor help them, if we are negligent in our Duty towards him. If therefore we deſire that our Armies and Fleets may make a conſiderable Figure in the World, let us not grudge at and cenſure every thing our Betters do, but be careful to do our Duty to God and Man, then after the enduring for a Seaſon the Inconveniencies of War, we may hope to be happy in a laſting Peace. <hi>Amen.</hi>
